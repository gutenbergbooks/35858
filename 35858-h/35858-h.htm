<p class="pfirst">“I can’t keep her in the air any longer,
Dad!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill Bolton shot the words into the mouthpiece
of his headphone and pushed the stick
gently forward. The amphibian which he was
driving nosed into a long gliding arc toward the
angry whitecaps of the Bay of Florida, a thousand
feet below.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Too much wind?” called back Mr. Bolton
from his seat in the rear cockpit.</p>
<p class="pnext">With a sharp bank Bill saved the plane a side-slip
as an unusually heavy gust caught her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Too much wind is right. Those black
clouds to the southeast mean a hurricane or I’m
a landlubber. We’re soon going to be in for it
good and plenty. It’s already kicked up a heavy
sea below. I should have landed sooner.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If we crash, we’ll have a long swim,” was
his father’s sole comment.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill cut his gun and having brought the plane
into the teeth of the wind which was increasing
in violence momentarily, he shot a quick glance
overside. Row after row of spume-capped
combers met his eye and his face became grim
with determination.</p>
<p class="pnext">At an altitude of perhaps twenty-five feet
he began to draw the stick slowly backward,
breaking his glide. Careful not to stall her,
with his eyes on the water just ahead he allowed
the nose to come gradually up until the amphibian
was in level flight. In such a wind this
proved a most difficult evolution, for savage
squalls lashed the plane until she acted like a
wild colt on a leading rope; and a crash seemed
imminent.</p>
<p class="pnext">Struggling to keep the plane on an even keel,
Bill continued to pull back his stick, raising the
nose and depressing the tail. Then with a final
pull he stalled her, the heel of the step made
contact with the top of a whitecap and amid a
cloud of spray the amphibian skimmed ahead
on the water. Before her nose could play off,
Bill had the sea anchor overside and a moment
later the heavy boat was tugging on the line to
the collapsible canvas bucket that kept her head
into the wind.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill whipped off his headphone and goggles.
Then he made the pilot’s cockpit secure by
cleating down a waterproof tarpaulin over the
top, flush with the deck, and climbed into the
rear cockpit which had seats for two passengers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Vast clouds growing out of the southeast
almost covered the heavens now, concealing the
sun. And as it grew darker the wind’s velocity
steadily increased.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’ll ride better with me aft,” he explained
to his father, “and the tarpaulin will
shed water like a deck. If the fore cockpit
shipped one of those big seas, we’d fill up and
go down like a plummet.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I admit that I’m not much of a seafaring
man,” said Mr. Bolton, “but why you keep the
plane heading into those combers is beyond me!
Why not run before the gale? Wouldn’t we
ride easier?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Possibly—but we can’t get into position to
do that now. I threw over the sea anchor to
keep her as she is.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why did you do that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Because if I hadn’t, she’d have nosed round
broadside to the waves and foundered with the
weight of the water pouring down on her lower
wing sections. If I tried to bring her before
the wind now, she’d do exactly that as soon as
her head played off.”</p>
<p class="pnext">In the white glare of a lightning flash which
brightened the horizon for an instant, Mr. Bolton
glimpsed his son, staring into the teeth of
the storm.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then why didn’t you land the plane with
the wind instead of heading into it?” he queried
in a perplexed tone.</p>
<p class="pnext">“All landings must be made directly into the
wind, Dad,” Bill explained patiently. “A
plane stalls when its speed through the air drops
below a certain point. If there’s no wind its
speed over the surface will be the same as its
speed through the air. But any wind at once
affects its velocity over the surface, which will
be the composition of the speed of the plane
through the air with the speed of the air over
the surface. You see, a plane which stalls at
forty miles an hour will, when landing into a
fifteen-mile wind, make contact at twenty-five
miles an hour. The same plane headed down-wind
would land at fifty-five miles an hour.
And that difference of thirty miles an hour in
landing speed might easily spell the difference
between a good landing and a wrecked plane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">His father smiled in the darkness.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You talk like a textbook, Bill. But you do
seem to have learned something at Annapolis
during the past year.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Learned that in flight training, before I
entered the Naval Academy,” replied his son.
He ducked his head as an unusually vicious
wave swept over the forward decking, deluging
the two in the cockpit with stinging spray.
“This is going to be a wet vacation, by the looks
of things.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who’d have thought we’d be in this fix
when we left Key West at four this afternoon!
Now we’re stranded—somewhere in the Bay of
Florida—and instead of dining cheerily with
the Wilsons at Miami, and going on to that important
business conference afterwards—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re likely to make good bait for the
sharks in this neighborhood!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t suppose there’s anything we can do,
son?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not a thing—but grin and bear it until this
wind blows itself out.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And it will get worse before it gets better!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sure! Cheer up, Dad—we’ll weather it
yet.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t mind me, Bill. I’m—that is, I’m
not feeling quite myself. Haven’t since we
came down, as a matter of fact. I’ve never
been—seasick—before—” Mr. Bolton’s voice
sounded rather feeble.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s the motion, combined with the smell of
gasoline, Dad. Every naval flyer knows that
feeling, your son included, at this particular
time. You’ll feel better when you’re empty.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I certainly hope so,” faltered Mr. Bolton.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just let your mind rest on a fatty piece of
pork swimming in its own hot grease, for a
starter,” Bill suggested, grinning to himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mmmm—” Bill’s father stood up suddenly
and leaned far overside.</p>
<p class="pnext">His son followed suit almost immediately.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently they returned to their places, weak
and empty, but considerably more comfortable.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I wonder why the thought of fat pork always
gets one going,” mused Bill, handing his
father the water bottle.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton slaked his thirst and handed it
back, whereupon Bill took a couple of long
pulls.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Feel better, Dad?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, thanks.” He paused a moment, then
continued in his normal tone. “The plane
doesn’t seem to be pitching so wildly—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, the wind is increasing steadily, and
flattening out the water.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Isn’t there something we can do now?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. It’s getting pretty wet in here. Give
me a hand with this tarpaulin, please.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Batten down the cockpit cover.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But, my boy!” Mr. Bolton’s voice showed
a trace of nervousness for the first time. “If
we put the cover on the cockpit, we’ll be
drowned like rats in a trap if the plane goes
down. I confess I’m not keen on the idea.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If the plane founders, we’ll drown anyway,”
was his son’s business-like reply. “No
swimmer could live more than a minute in
water like this. We’re in a tight fix, Dad, and
our only chance is to ride out the gale. This
plane will sink like a stone, once the real hurricane
hits us, unless she is pretty near watertight
overall. Let’s get busy before the wind makes
the job impossible.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I guess you’re skipper,” Mr. Bolton replied,
and he hastened to comply with Bill’s request.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was difficult work fastening on the waterproof
cover from the inside, but at last it was
accomplished, and Bill flashed on his electric
torch. With some trouble, because of the violent
pitching and rolling of their little ship, he
took down the two passenger seats which were
collapsible, and stowed them in the luggage
hold aft. It now became possible for father
and son to sit upright on the flooring.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re as snug as a couple of bugs in a rug,
now,” breezed Bill with satisfaction as he made
the last seat secure.</p>
<p class="pnext">“More like nailing down the lid of our
coffin,” observed his father. “I hope I’m not
afraid to meet my Maker, but I’d much prefer
doing so in the open. However, I am certainly
proud of the way you’re handling things, my
boy. From now on, I’ll stop grumbling. When
you reach my age, you’ll find that an upset
stomach paints everything else black.”</p>
<p class="pnext">With startling suddenness, the howl of the
wind stilled, and the two in the cockpit could
hear plainly the splash of the waves against the
hull. This eerie silence lasted for perhaps a
minute, to be superseded by a dull roar that grew
stronger and louder every split second.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hold fast! Here she comes!” shouted Bill.
With his back against one wall and his feet
against the other, he braced his body for the
shock of the wind.</p>
<p class="pnext">In a crescendo of thunderous warning the
hurricane struck them. Down and still further
down went the nose of the plane beneath the
smashing wind.</p>
<p class="pnext">Would she never come up? Would the
anchor line hold? Bill wondered frantically.
Then he caught his father’s twisted smile, and
answered it with another. Dad was a real
sport—true, he was a business man, and more
at home in a swivel-chair behind a desk than in
a pounding seaplane in a gale. But the old man
was right there when it came to real pluck.
That smile, with beads of perspiration standing
out on his forehead proved it. Bill tingled with
pride and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was different, of course, with himself. He
was a midshipman and a flyer, and it was his
business to take risks. This was about the
tightest fix he had been in so far, he thought.
Never had he heard anything like the fearsome,
shrieking roar of this wind.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ah! The plane’s head was rising! He could
feel it. Soon the sea would get up again.
Would they be able to ride out the storm?</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton fished a notebook and pencil out
of his pocket, and after writing a few words,
passed them to Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you a map of these waters?” he had
written.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill shook his head. “It’s in the forward
cockpit,” he wrote. “We were about twenty-five
miles south of Oyster Keys when we landed.
The mainland is a few miles north of them.
Uninhabited mangrove swamps, I think.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He passed back the notebook and pencil.
And after glancing at what he had written, Mr.
Bolton scribbled a few more words and handed
Bill the book again.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about Oyster Keys?” read his son.</p>
<p class="pnext">The wind was making less commotion now,
so Bill tried using his voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Low-lying islets,” he shouted. “I don’t
think anybody lives there. Even head on to
the storm as we are, the plane is drifting toward
the keys—sure to be.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s good,” shouted back his father.
“Maybe we’ll make one of them by morning.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope not!” was Bill’s reply. “Not in the
sea that will be running by then. We’d smash
up sure in the breakers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton made no answer to this announcement
and Bill spoke again. “We may need this
flashlight again before morning, Dad. The
batteries are small. They won’t last forever.
Sorry, but I’m afraid we’ll have to sit it out in
the dark.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton nodded. “Goodnight—-and good
luck, son.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill snapped off the light. For what seemed
a long time he sat there in darkness so black
that with a hand held close to his eyes, he was
unable to see the faintest outline of it. The
strain and excitement were beginning to make
themselves felt. Bill began to realize that he
was tired. He curled up into a more comfortable
position and rested his head on his arms.
Five minutes later he was sound asleep.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was awakened from dreamless slumber
as his head struck something hard and unyielding.
His hand sought the electric torch in his
pocket and drew it forth. By its light he saw
his father sleeping on the flooring close to him.
A glance at his wristwatch showed that it was
five o’clock, and therefore daylight. He wound
the watch, and without waking his father, undid
a corner of the cockpit cover.</p>
<p class="pnext">The wind had fallen to a fraction of its
former strength. A grey, cloudswept sky met
his gaze, and below it, towering waves which
seemed bent on burying the small craft beneath
tumbling torrents of angry water. The plane
was probably leaking a bit, but that was to be
expected after the beating she had been taking
all night long, and was still taking. Staunch
little bus!</p>
<p class="pnext">Then he turned his head and involuntarily
caught his breath. Dead aft and not a quarter
of a mile away lay a long line of pounding
breakers!</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-iithe-key">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id3">CHAPTER II—THE KEY</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“Good morning, son,” said a voice behind
Bill. “Reckon the Old Man got his wish.
One of the Oyster Keys, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Shouldn’t be surprised,” returned Bill
without enthusiasm. “We’ll soon know more
about it. At the rate the plane is drifting
backwards, we’ll be up to the breakers in about
an hour.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about starting the engine and—er—sheering
off?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not in a sea like this, Dad. She’d go down
in a minute, just as soon as her head played off.
Our only chance is that she drifts past that point
over there to starboard. There may be a bay
behind it and if we can make quieter water, we
may win out yet.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton slapped him on the shoulder.
“That’s the way to talk! You’re a great comfort
to your old Dad. How about a little breakfast
before rounding the point, eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill laughed. “You’re on, sir,—if you’ll
take off these cockpit covers, I’ll go below for
the emergency rations!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Make it snappy, then. I’m hungry enough
to eat a horse. Or fat pork swimming in its
own grease, for that matter!”</p>
<p class="pnext">By the time Mr. Bolton had the tarpaulins
stowed away. Bill produced sandwiches and
coffee hot from the thermos bottle.</p>
<p class="pnext">“New life and no mistake,” Mr. Bolton remarked,
munching contentedly. “What do you
think of our chances now that you’re able to
satisfy the inner man, Bill?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not very good, sir. The tide is carrying us
toward the point, but this wind is causing us to
drift backward onto the breakers at a rate of at
least three feet to the tide’s one.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t see any signs of life on the island,”
observed his father.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, if anybody lives on that key, the house
is behind the cliffs. I’ve been watching for a
sign of smoke, but haven’t sighted anything so
far. Queer formation, those cliffs, for this
part of the world. Most of the islands are so
low and flat they’re covered with water at high
tide.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They finished their breakfast in a leisurely
manner, and stowed away the remainder of the
food.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I guess we aren’t going to make the point,”
said Bill when their tailplane lay not more than
a quarter of a mile off the breakers. “I’ve got
another idea, though. Stupid of me not to have
thought of it before. It’s a ticklish job, but if
I don’t swamp her, we ought to get round that
promontory.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Anything is better than this inaction.
What’s the good word?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m going into the fore cockpit and start the
engine.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean we can pull in the sea anchor
and taxi out of this dangerous position?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hardly that. The old bus would pound to
pieces in this sea if I tried to send her over these
waves. The idea is to give her just enough
headway to offset the wind drift that is driving
her ashore. I want to keep her the same distance
off the surf that she is now. The tide
will then have a chance to carry us sideways
round the point. There’s bound to be quieter
water to leeward of that headland.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sounds fine! Anyway, it gives us a chance.
What can I do to help?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Crawl out on the nose, please. When I give
the word, haul in the anchor line. If you try
to get the sea anchor aboard from a cockpit the
bus will slew to the side and I’ll never be able
to keep her headed into the wind.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill took his place at the controls in the fore
cockpit and idled the engine until he was convinced
everything was running smoothly. Then
he placed his feet on the rudder pedals and
motioned his father to proceed.</p>
<p class="pnext">The huge white-capped rollers, aftermath
of the hurricane, tossed the plane up and down
as though each oncoming wave was bent on
destroying her. Bill knew that his father’s
task was no easy one. The decking forward of
the cockpit was rounded and absolutely smooth.
There were no handholds to prevent one slipping
off its wet surface.</p>
<p class="pnext">With a smile, the middle aged gentleman
climbed out of the cockpit, lay flat on the deck
and wormed his way toward the nose with a
wriggling motion that allowed both his arms
and his legs to hug the slick planking.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arrived at the end of his short but perilous
journey he sat up, and straddled the deck as
though he were riding a very broad horse.
Then with a hand on the anchor line, he looked
back over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill was ready for him to start, and with his
stick held well back of neutral to prevent the
nose dipping under the waves and throwing
spray into the propeller, he held up his free
hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton immediately started to haul in
the line and Bill opened his throttle. Keeping
just enough headway on the plane to be sure
he could hold her pointed as he wished, he
waited until the sea anchor was on board and
his father safely aft in the passenger cockpit
again, and then slightly accelerated the engine.
Even this small burst of speed caused the amphibian
to bury its nose in the combers; and all
but foundered her under a torrent of sea water.
Bill instantly idled down until the staunch little
craft was moving through the water at the speed
of a fast walk. He soon found that by keeping
her going at this rate he prevented her drifting
backward with the wind. Deviations from
his heading were prevented by use of the
throttle rudder and ailerons.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was strenuous work, fighting waves in a
heavy amphibian, and incomparably more tiring
than driving her through the air. Moreover it
took his whole power of will and concentration
to keep her head from playing off and becoming
the forerunner of sure disaster. His
back and shoulders began to ache under the
strain; and soon his leg muscles were an added
source of torture because of the excessive pressure
he was forced to use on the rudder pedals.
He dared not shift his gaze aft, so when they
had been travelling the monstrous treadmill
grind for an hour by the clock, he hailed his
father: “How are we making it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The roar of the propeller and engine almost
drowned the words as the wind whipped them
back to Mr. Bolton. Sensing, however, that
his son wanted something, he donned a headphone
and picked up Bill’s set on the other end
of the line. He climbed out of the cockpit and
leaned over Bill, adjusting the receiver and
transmitter so that the busy pilot could talk to
him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What did you say?” he asked from the rear
cockpit once more.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Want to know if we’ll round the point. If
I turn to look, I’ll swamp her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sorry,” returned his father. “I hadn’t
realized—— Yes, we’re abreast of the head
now. There seems to be quite a large cove and
quiet water beyond. Can’t make it out just yet.
Anything else?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. When we’re round, let me know
what’s behind the head.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For nearly ten minutes there was no further
conversation. Then Bill heard his father’s
voice in his ears again.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re past now. That head is the western
end of the island, and behind it is an almost
landlocked cove. You’ll have to make a turn
to the left to get in there. Think you can do it
OK?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s a case of have to, I guess,” was Bill’s
answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">He closed the throttle and, careful to maintain
sufficient speed for steerageway, allowed
the plane to drift backward in the heavy wind
until the mouth of the little harbor lay off his
port quarter. Exerting pressure on left rudder,
he allowed the plane’s nose to play off to port
for the fraction of a second, then kicked her
ahead and dead into the wind again, so as to
take the advancing wave nose on.</p>
<p class="pnext">Soon their slow progress to port was perceptible.
As they drew closer into the lee of the
headland, the wind was less violent, the waves
though high lost their caps of white spume.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill gauged his distances to a nicety. His
spurts to port became longer, until at last he
manœuvered his craft, floating backward and
sideways, to leeward of the narrow opening
between the cliffs. Then with a vigorous burst
of the engine, he swung round to port and sent
the amphibian hurtling into the harbor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Splendid, son, splendid!” sang out Mr.
Bolton, as Bill cut his gun and ripped off his
headphone. “We certainly are in luck. This
island is evidently inhabited, after all. Look
over there!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill was already scanning the cove with a
gaze that grasped every detail. As the plane
continued to float shoreward over the quiet
water, he saw that the harbor was almost landlocked.
Broad white beaches ended abruptly
in steep cliffs, forty or fifty feet high. Directly
ahead a long concrete pier jutted into the bay
and nearby a large yacht and two big amphibians
lay at their moorings.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, there are people here,” replied Bill.
“That road zig-zagging up the cliffs probably
leads to the houses. Funny that nobody has
sighted us. I wonder what they’re doing with
a sea-going yacht and a couple of planes?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Some millionaire’s hobby, no doubt. This
key probably belongs to him. Hadn’t we better
tie up to the dock and go ashore? We’ve had a
strenuous time of it, and I frankly admit I’m
dog tired. Clean sheets and a comfortable bed,
for five or six hours, will make new men of us
both.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m with you,” smiled his son and sent their
plane skimming toward the pier. They made
fast to a couple of ringbolts in the concrete and
after securing the plane, picked up their suitcases
and stepped ashore. Without further
waste of time they breasted the winding road
that led up the cliff.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope you’re right about the millionaire,”
remarked Bill, as he trudged beside his father.
“That should mean a comfortable house and a
good feed. Sandwiches are all right, but they
don’t go very far when you’re downright
hungry!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, this road cost a lot of money to build,”
puffed Mr. Bolton. “It seems to me that this
key is the winter home of some pretty wealthy
people. Ah, here we are—top at last!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The cliff they had just ascended evidently
extended entirely around the shoreline of the
key. Before them the ground sloped into a
natural, bowl-like depression. This valley ran
the length and breadth of the island, which was
about five miles long by two miles wide. The
road, gleaming white in the morning sun, ran
straight down the valley, to a group of low white
buildings, a mile or so away. A heavy growth
of trees and shrubs covered the valley. There
seemed to have been no attempt to cultivate the
soil, and except for the road, the group of
buildings and a large house that perched on a
knoll in mid-valley, nature had been allowed
to run its own pace.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quite a settlement,” commented Mr.
Bolton.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And quite a walk—in this hot sun,”
grumbled Bill, shifting his loaded suitcase from
one hand to the other.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, it will do us good to stretch our legs.
Come along. Southern hospitality is famous,
you know. We’re sure to get a warm welcome,
especially in this out-of-the-way place.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s warm enough for me, right now,” retorted
Bill. “Gee—what’s that!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Halt!” cried a rough voice. “Stand where
you are, or I’ll fire!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Two men sprang from behind the cover of
a rocky outcropping near the roadside. Both of
the newcomers held repeating rifles at the ready.
They advanced down the incline toward the
Boltons.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-iiiprisoners">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id4">CHAPTER III—PRISONERS</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The armed strangers were a swarthy, black-browed
pair, clad in sleeveless cotton under-shirts
and ragged cotton trousers of no particular
hue. Both wore the floppy, broadbrimmed
straw hats common in the tropics, both were
barefoot and carried canvas cartridge belts slung
over their left shoulders. A more villainous
pair could not be found anywhere.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Stick ’em up!” commanded the taller of
the two.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill dropped his suitcase and defiantly thrust
his hands into the pockets of his breeches.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re not armed,” he said steadily, and
ignoring the man’s angry growl, turned to his
father. “If this is a sample of the famous
hospitality you were talking about, Dad, a little
of it is plenty!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Search ’em and search ’em good, Diego!”
shouted the leader. “If they make a move ter
pull a rod, I’ll drill ’em.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But, I say—— Hold on!” Mr. Bolton exclaimed
indignantly as Diego relieved him of
his watch and wallet.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hold up, you mean,” remarked Bill grimly.
“A sweet gang of robbers we’ve fallen into if
the rest of them on this key are anything like
these two thugs.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Shut yer mouth, or it’ll be the worse fer
youse!” snapped the highwayman. “Mebbe
yer get dese tings back when yer goes up ter de
big house, an’ mebbe yer don’t. Dat’s none o’
my business. It’s up ter de boss.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll bet he’s a gentleman of the old school,”
mocked Bill. “Tell me, Bozo, what do they
call this place? Who is the hospitable owner?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ain’t none o’ yer business,” snarled the man.
“Gimme more o’ yer lip, an’ I’ll give yer
de butt of dis rifle between de eyes. Pick up
dem bags and march. Straight down de road—dat’s
de way.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Forced to obey, the Boltons took up their
suitcases again and continued along the dusty
highway, but this time accompanied by an
armed rear guard.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re arriving in style, anyway, with an
armed guard,” Bill muttered to his father.
“What sort of a dump do you suppose we’ve
crashed into?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton, whose face was crimson with
annoyance, shot a glance of reproof at the tall,
broad-shouldered young fellow at his side.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whatever it is, you’ll only make things
worse by trying to heckle these people. The
men behind are quite evidently underlings.
When we meet this boss they speak of, it will
be time enough to demand an explanation. Why
the owner of this place should treat strangers in
this cavalier manner is beyond me, I confess.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you ask me, Dad, I believe we are walking
into a mess that has last night’s seance at sea
beat forty ways to Sunday.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope you are wrong,” his father answered
stiffly. “But if Diego and his loud-voiced
friend aren’t criminals they should be, with
faces like theirs. We certainly seem to have
been blown out of the frying pan straight into
the fire.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Quarter of an hour’s walk brought them to
the first of the buildings they had sighted from
the hillside. Closer inspection proved it to be
a long, one-storied affair with a flat roof and
whitewashed stucco walls. It looked hot and
stuffy, and the Boltons noted that the small
windows set high up were barred with rusty
iron.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Looks like a Mexican jail to me,” declared
Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve never seen one,” his father replied.
Mr. Bolton was in no state, physically or mentally,
for facetious conversation.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Neither have I, except in the movies—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ dis is where we stops. In yer goes!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Diego’s partner appeared at Bill’s elbow and
motioned toward the building with the muzzle
of his gun. Diego, who so far had made no observation
of his own, produced a key. The heavy
door swung inward and the Boltons were rudely
forced to enter.</p>
<p class="pnext">They came into a fair-sized room, sparsely
furnished with a chair and a few wooden
benches. As they passed into a long corridor
lined with cells, Diego’s pal relieved them of
their suitcases, while Diego unlocked a door and
motioned with his rifle for father and son to
step into the cell.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is an outrage!” exploded Mr. Bolton.</p>
<p class="pnext">Without a word, Diego slammed and locked
the door behind them.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill, who feared that a show of resistance
might cause the men to separate him from his
father, cut in upon his parent’s fury.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hey, you, Diego!” he called.</p>
<p class="pnext">Diego stopped and turned round.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Speak English?” Bill pressed his face
against the bars and stared at the man, who exhibited
no sign that he understood.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My Naval Academy Spanish won’t pass
muster, so I reckon it must be English,” continued
Bill ruefully. “Anyway, I’ll take a
chance. Look here, Diego. Bring my father
and me something to drink—something cool and
wet—with ice in it if you can—and I’ll make
it all right with you when the boss learns who
we are and lets us go. If I’m talking too fast
for you to follow, I’ll say it all over again. How
about it, my lad, do you get me?”</p>
<p class="pnext">A sour grin spread over Diego’s none too prepossessing
visage.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Youse an’ yer ole man go blow yer tops!”
he replied in the best Bowery argot. “Whadda
yer take dis joint for—de Waldorf?”</p>
<p class="pnext">He spat his contempt on the filthy floor and
passed out of sight.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You never can tell when you’ll run into
home-folks,” said Bill with a smile at Mr.
Bolton.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill’s father looked hot and desperately
weary. He spoke in a dejected tone. “I admire
your cheerfulness, son, in this trying position.
But if you will desist from buffooning the
situation, it would be a relief to me. Of course,
I realize our arrest is a mistake. And the owner
of this island will surely make amends as soon
as I tell him who we are. In missing that conference
in Miami last night, my entire business
interests were jeopardized. If I can’t get there
before those men leave for the North, you and I,
boy, are liable to suffer a heavy financial loss.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill tossed his jacket on the dirty floor and
sat down with his back to the wall. “Thanks,
Dad—but I guess you know I’m not playing for
admiration. I realize the seriousness of this
mess we’re in just as fully as you do. And one
thing I do believe: we’re going to have to shell
out plenty of cash in a very little while, if you
let the ‘boss’ over at the big house know you’re
Bolton of the Bolton Sugar Corporation!”</p>
<p class="pnext">His father looked at him sharply. “What do
you mean?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe,” went on Bill, “that this is going
to be a hold-up game from start to finish. If we
haven’t dropped into the winter hangout of
some Chicago beer baron or New York racketeer,
I’m a ground hog!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mmm—ransom, you mean?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do. I shouldn’t be surprised at anything
after meeting Diego and his bullying pal. Any
man who would hire a couple of gunmen like
those fellows is sure to be a bad egg. And we’re
getting a taste of his generous hospitality right
now. Of course, I don’t know what his particular
game is, but it’s bound to be something
pretty low. When he finds out you’re a power
in the business world, he’s sure to bleed you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I dare say you’re right,” his father returned
gloomily. “I’ll have to keep my identity hidden.
By thunder!” he slapped his knee in vexation.
“The man knows <em class="italics">now</em>, exactly who I am.
Those villains took my wallet! My cards and
some valuable papers were in it, to say nothing
of the currency I carried, though he can have
that and welcome.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Tough luck, Dad—-I never thought of that.
Now we are in for it. Ugh! I wish those birds
would bring us a drink. My mouth hurts, it’s
so dry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Filthy place, this—what with the stench
and the heat—One of these days I’ll make it
even hotter for the man who is accountable for
this!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sh!” cautioned Bill. “Here they come!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Diego and the other man came into sight between
the bars. Diego unlocked the cell door.</p>
<p class="pnext">“On yer way!” he barked. “De big boss
wants ter look youse over.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Anything’s better than this hole,” observed
Mr. Bolton, and picking up his coat he preceded
Bill out of the cell.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mebbe—and mebbe not,” said Diego’s
partner, and they both chuckled hoarsely.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about some water to drink?” inquired
Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do I look like a soda fountain? Tell yer
troubles to de boss. Servin’ drinks ain’t my
job.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The sun’s heat was terrific out on the road,
and the glare was blinding. All wind from the
sea was cut off by the valley, and the very trees
seemed to shimmer under the broiling rays.</p>
<p class="pnext">They passed several other buildings which
looked like barracks and warehouses, but saw
no people. If there were any, they remained
indoors.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is a sweet place to pick for a winter
home,” gasped Bill, mopping his streaming
forehead. “The thug who runs things here
must be a darned cold-blooded guy.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Very probably,” returned Mr. Bolton, “but
the place, though hot, has its advantages, if he
is what we surmise. It is quite out of the world,
and except from the air, no one would guess that
the island is inhabited.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Home at last,” remarked Bill after a few
minutes, as they turned up the incline toward
the white house on the knoll. “Thank heaven
there’s a bit of a breeze up here. Whew! This
bird certainly lives in style!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The road swept up through beautifully kept
flower gardens to the front of the house, which
appeared to be a really huge mansion. Wide
verandas surrounded the rambling building on
three sides, and the cream stucco walls contrasted
pleasingly with the dark green of its tile
roof. Money had been spent here with a lavish
hand. The place looked cool and inviting. The
Boltons wondered what it would hold for them.</p>
<p class="pnext">They were led into a spacious hall, panelled
in mahogany. Here again, the Persian rugs
scattered over the polished floor, the fine wood
and carving of the furniture, and a number of
excellent paintings on the walls, all bespoke the
hand of wealth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bidding his prisoners remain where they
were, Diego crossed the hall and knocked at a
closed door.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Come in,” called a man’s voice, and Diego
disappeared into the room, closing the door
behind him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill started to make some comment on their
surroundings to his father, but their other guard
growled at him to keep quiet. Then Diego
reappeared and beckoned them into the room.</p>
<p class="pnext">This large apartment was handsomely furnished
in the manner of a business office. Behind
a huge, flat-topped desk sat a fat young
man dressed in immaculate white linens. Blue-black
hair and an olive complexion bespoke his
Latin origin. Two other young men, clad also
in white, and bearing a strong resemblance to
the man at the desk, lounged in wicker arm
chairs. All were smoking long black cigars.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And what, may I ask, is the reason for this
outrage?” began Mr. Bolton, walking up to the
desk. “Is it your custom to have visitors to this
island treated like criminals and thrown into
jail?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It is,” the fat man remarked blandly, without
removing the cigar from his lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill’s father was taken aback by this unadulterated
candor, but neither by manner nor
change of tone did he betray his surprise. “How
much do you want to let us go?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The man at the desk knocked the ash from
his cigar.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, it’s not a question of money at the
present moment, Mr. Bolton. That will undoubtedly
come later. Just now, my brothers
and I have need of you in other ways.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean that we are to be kept here as your
prisoners?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You have guessed the secret, Mr. Bolton.
And my advice to you and to your son is to do
exactly as you are told, without argument or
question. Strangers on Shell Island have always
found that to disobey commands here is a
particularly unhealthy pastime. Obey on the
jump—is our slogan. I hope for your sakes
that neither of you forgets it.” He smiled at
them affably and puffed on his cigar.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton was about to speak his mind when
Bill caught his arm. “Stow it, Dad,” he said.
“That lad has us just where he wants us. I’d
like to say what I think, too,—but what’s the
use?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Their host waved his hand and their guards
led the Boltons out of the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">Once on the road, tramping back toward the
settlement below, Mr. Bolton passed his arm
through Bill’s.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Your Naval Academy training has put a
head on your shoulders, son,” he said affectionately.
“You have developed better control of
your temper under stress than I have. I’m glad
you stopped me. Ordinarily a man of my position
in the world is in the habit of speaking his
mind when provoked.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded. “One of these days,” he said
grimly, “I’m going to get that fat slob in there—and
when I do, there won’t be enough left of
him for the state to burn. What’s his game?
Have you any idea?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Bolton shook his head. “Not the slightest
glimmer. It doesn’t appear to be a case of
ransom—or at least, not just yet. Whatever he
is up to is obviously illegal. But we’ll probably
learn about it before long. The man is an
educated criminal. His actions prove it. Our
position is certainly serious—very serious.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I vote we make a stab at getting out of that
cell tonight,” suggested Bill. “If I can get
hold of our bus or one of the other amphibians,
we’ll get clear of Shell Island in short order.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’ll spend the day thinking up a plan of
operations,” agreed his father.</p>
<p class="pnext">As they came into the settlement, Diego
tapped Bill on the shoulder. “Come along with
me, guy,” he ordered. “Not you—” he snarled
at Mr. Bolton as he started to turn out of the
road with his son. “Back to the lockup for
yours!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good bye, Dad, and good luck,” Bill called
as Diego’s partner herded his father down the
road.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good luck, and keep a brave heart,” answered
Mr. Bolton.</p>
<p class="pnext">He called out something else, but Bill could
not catch the words, for Diego had him by the
arm and forced him through the doorway of the
barracks before which they had been standing.</p>
<p class="pnext">He found himself in a large room where
thirty or forty men quite as villainous-looking as
his guard were lounging about, smoking, sleeping
or playing cards. Diego hurried him
through this apartment, and down a bare hallway
to the open door of a small room. Bill saw
that except for an unpainted table and a chair
of the kitchen variety, the place was empty of
furniture. Over the chair a coarse cotton shirt
and a pair of cotton trousers were draped. Leg-irons
and a pair of handcuffs lay on the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Strip!” Diego pointed to the chair.
“Them’s your clothes, guy. Get into ’em.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about wearing my own?” Bill was
fast losing his temper. Only the rifle which
Diego held pointed in his direction prevented
him from sending a right hand jab to the point
of the thug’s chin and taking his chance with
the others in the room beyond.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nuttin’ doin’, bo—” snarled Diego.
“Dem’s de boss’s orders. Make it snappy. We
gotta get out o’ here right away an’ I want to
pin de jewelry on yer.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where are we going?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I ain’t goin’ nowhere—but you are—” He
grinned evilly at the lad—“youse is goin’ ter be
took fer a ride.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-ivthe-invitation">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id5">CHAPTER IV—THE INVITATION</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Diego gave vent to a raucous laugh after
making this announcement. He walked across
the room, leaned his rifle against the table, and
picking up the handcuffs inspected them critically.
His prisoner was unarmed and too far
away to offer an assault before he could snatch
up his gun again. He did not fear Bill physically.
But many people misjudged that slender
body with the broad shoulders. The young midshipman
was not yet seventeen; nevertheless he
was star right end on the Navy team and as
strong as a steel bridge. Now he saw his chance
and took it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bending down as though to untie the pair of
rubber soled sneakers he wore, Bill suddenly half
straightened and his lithe form shot through the
air. Before Diego could drop the handcuffs,
one hundred and sixty pounds of bone and muscle
struck him just above the knees and he
crashed over backward beneath a perfect tackle.
The unexpected jar and shock half-stunned him
and before he could gather his faculties, Bill’s
fist, backed by the venom of a sorely tried temper
smashed him behind his left ear. All lights
went out for Diego, gangster and gunman,
right there.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill scrambled to his feet, ran to the open
door and peered out. The corridor was empty.
He closed and bolted the door and after a moment’s
thought, he approached the unconscious
gangster.</p>
<p class="pnext">Five minutes later, a young man clad in cotton
undershirt, ragged cotton trousers and rubber
soled sneakers stepped through an open window
on to the wide veranda which ran along the side
of the barracks. On the young man’s head was
a floppy broadbrimmed hat of straw. He carried
a rifle. The owner of these articles lay
on the floor behind the window, quite oblivious.
When he came to again, he would find his wrists
manacled behind his back, his right leg chained
to the table, and a gag in his mouth. As Bill
Bolton walked swiftly along the veranda, he
conjured up the pleasing picture of Diego’s
awakening, and grinned.</p>
<p class="pnext">With the hat’s brim pulled well down and
acting as a partial screen to his features, he ran
down the broad wooden steps and out to the road.
Not a soul was in sight. Then suddenly his
heart missed a beat.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hey, you! Where you goin’?” called a
voice from the porch behind him, and a man he
had not seen before ran down the steps. Just
then a large handbell was rung somewhere
within the building.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Come in and get yer chow,” called the man.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill felt that he would certainly cause suspicion
if he refused to obey this suggestion.
Moreover, he was thirsty and half famished. So
he walked back to the steps.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I reckon you’re one of the new hands on
the yacht,” observed the man.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s right,” admitted Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thought so, when I seen yer beatin’ down
toward the harbor just afore dinner time. The
boss feeds us swell here. Has to, with this gang
to look after. Men get easy discontented in a
sweatbox like this here island. How’s the grub
aboard the <em class="italics">Pelican</em>?. Useter be pretty bad.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve eaten worse,” said Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, come along in and feed here today,”
turning back up the steps with him. “It’s a hot
walk along that shell road, and I’ll need yer to
help herd some of them prisoners down there
later on.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill followed him into the building. This
time he found the large room deserted, and
passing through a doorway to the right, the two
entered a big hall, down the middle of which
ran two long, narrow tables.</p>
<p class="pnext">The men were already seated at dinner, and
nobody paid the slightest attention to the new
arrivals. Bill’s companion took his place at the
head of a table and motioned the lad to a vacant
seat just below. A pitcher of what proved to be
lemonade was within Bill’s reach. He filled
and emptied his glass three times before he
began to feel refreshed. A slatternly negress
placed a plate piled high with fried chicken,
rice and fried plantains before him and he dug
into it with the relish of a starved man.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Reckon the <em class="italics">Pelican’s</em> chow ain’t so good,
the way you tackle yer dinner,” laughed the
man at the table’s head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If they have fried chicken aboard, it never
gets for’ard of the cabin,” Bill grinned back.
He knew that his identity might be discovered
at any time and planned to make the most of the
meal while he could.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I run the commissariat and the men here at
the barracks,” his new acquaintance informed
him. “Y’ got to feed ’em right to keep ’em contented.
The boss is liberal. ‘He knows his oats.
Bum chow makes fer fights and knifin’s in this
climate.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded and kept on eating. A man
further down the table raised his voice above
the clatter of cutlery on dishes and the hum of
conversation.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you hear about the two guys that blew
in here on a plane this morning, Tom?” he asked
the man at the end of the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I sure did,” laughed that person. “I guess
they didn’t know what they was bumpin’ into
when they hit Shell Island. You guys won’t
have to take so many trips to the mainland if
suckers come here of their own accord, eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The laughter became general. The men apparently
enjoyed the joke.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where are they now?” inquired another.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Tony and Diego’s got them over to the calaboose.
They was up to the big house and Martinengo
looked ’em over. It’s Bolton, the sugar
millionaire, and his boy.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The boss could squeeze a bunch o’ kale outen
that pair!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But then he’d have to let ’em go,” said Tom.
“And that would blow the gaff. He’s shippin’
them up to the workin’s this afternoon with the
rest of the bunch.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I bet there’ll be a holler raised, when old
man Bolton doesn’t show up at home,” observed
a voice far down the table. “That gang’s got
influence and friends. Yer can’t cop a millionaire
without runnin’ into trouble.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s where yer all wet, Zeppi,” called
down Tom. “Bolton’s influence won’t count
him nothin’ with the Martinengo boys; and his
friends will think he’s dead. Went down with
his son in the blow last night. There won’t be
no comeback. The two of ’em will be dead
soon. The workin’s ain’t no health resort.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll say they’re not,” returned Zeppi. “Martinengo
wouldn’t get me to stick ‘round that
dump—double pay or no double pay.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes, he would—and on the jump,” Tom
contradicted. “You’re a new man, Zeppi. Y’
got a lot to learn, and the first thing is that the
boss don’t ask—he orders—and so do I. Them
what tries to make trouble is put on the spot.
Get me?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Tom turned to Bill. “Some o’ these boobs
don’t know when they’s well off,” he remarked
genially. “What do they call yer, young
feller?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bill,” said Bill. He finished the last bit of
his food and poured himself another glass of
lemonade.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, Bill, if you hike back to the <em class="italics">Pelican</em>,
that bo’sun will put you to swabbin’ decks or
somethin’. I need you later and I’ll fix it up
with him. You go into the bunk room and turn
in with the rest of this crew. Gotta take yer rest
now—the bunch o’ you’ll be up all night.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill saw that he had no option but to obey,
so when the men left the table he went with
them. His plan had been to go to the jail,
overpower Tony and release his father. They
would then make for the harbor, take his
amphibian or one of the others moored in the
little bay and fly away. Now he realized that
he must conform to circumstances as he found
them. Nobody knew that he was not what Tom
took him for, a deck hand on the yacht <em class="italics">Pelican</em>.
If only Diego were not discovered, he would
make another sortie in an hour or so, when the
men were deep in their siesta.</p>
<p class="pnext">No sound came from behind the closed door
to the room where he had left the gunman, lying
gagged and bound, as he trooped down the hall
with the rest. The rear of the long corridor
opened into a huge, airy apartment which ran
the full width of the building. Screened windows
opened on to verandas on three sides. The
room looked like a hospital ward, with its long
rows of cots. At the head of each bed was a
wooden chest with a padlock for the owner’s
belongings. A single sheet and a blanket were
folded at the foot of the bed, under the pillow.
Everything was neat, and evidently kept in the
orderly arrangement of a military barracks.
Framed signs on the four walls read, “Silence—No
Talking.” Tom, though seemingly a genial
soul, ruled with an iron hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill spread his sheet on the cot pointed out to
him, and placed his pillow at the head of the
bed. Then he kicked off his sneakers and lay
down. Except for the sound of breathing and
the buzzing of a bluebottle against a window
screen, the place was absolutely quiet. It was
hot, notwithstanding the ventilation, but the
cot was comfortable, and try as he might, Bill
could not fight off the drowsiness that assailed
him.</p>
<p class="pnext">He awoke with a guilty start to the loud clang
of a ship’s bell and sat up on his cot. The hands
of the clock on the wall opposite marked five
o’clock. He had slept four hours.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I reckon you had a good snooze by the look
of them eyes o’ yourn,” remarked a jovial voice
and Bill looked up to see Tom standing at the
foot of the bed. “Make it snappy, now,” he
continued. “Take yer gun an’ wait fer me on
the front porch. I’ll be along in a minute and
I’m puttin’ you on the detail that’s goin’ down
to the harbor with them boys in the calaboose.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded and slipped into his sneakers.
He jammed his hat on his head, and picking up
his rifle, hurried from the room. He was angry
with himself for having fallen asleep, and now
that he had the chance, he meant to take it.
Tom, when he came out, would not find him on
the veranda. Bill made up his mind to beat the
detail over to the jail and to follow out his
original plan of rescuing his father and making
their getaway before the men arrived.</p>
<p class="pnext">He passed down the hall and on through the
lounge room, and was running lightly down the
piazza steps when a voice hailed him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hey, youse! Where d’ you think yer
headin’ for? Didn’t yer hear Tom tell yer to
stick around with this detail until he came?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stopped and looked back. The man called
Zeppi was leaning over the railing. Behind him
ten or a dozen men were lounging in various indolent
attitudes and laughing at this diversion.
Bill saw that they all carried rifles.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I guess youse ain’t been round dis dump
long,” Zeppi was still speaking. “Let me tell
yer, kid, t’ain’t healthy to disobey orders, ‘specially
Tom’s. He’s a soft-speakin’ guy, Tom is—but
I seen him shoot three guys in the last three
weeks fer doin’ no more than you done just now.
Get up on this porch before he shows up, if yer
ain’t tired o’ livin’.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill hid his disappointment and chagrin and
ran up the steps.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thanks,” he said. “I’m half asleep, Zeppi.
I didn’t think where I was going.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay with me, kid. I’m fair sick of seein’
guys put on the spot fer nuthin’ at all. Just
remember that when yer told the <em class="italics">porch</em>, don’t
go out in the road, or anywheres else, when they’s
Tom’s orders.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who’s talkin’ about me,” gruffed Tom from
the doorway. “Oh, it’s you, Zeppi! Well,
what’s the trouble now?”</p>
<p class="pnext">With a sleight-of-hand motion, he jerked an
automatic revolver from a holster under his left
armpit and covered the man.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay, Tom.” Zeppi dropped his rifle and
raised his hands above his head. “I was just
tellin’ the kid here that he should shake a leg
when it come to takin’ your orders, or—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, <em class="italics">that</em> was it, eh?” Tom cut him short
and put away the gun. “Sorry, Zeppi—I come
near drillin’ you. I’m always a bit rough after
a sleep—must watch myself. We’re losing too
many men. Get into line, you bozos,” he commanded,
“follow me by twos—march!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill fell in beside Zeppi, who winked at him.
The party clattered down the steps and started
along the white road at a smart pace. He felt
much as a man might who is being led to execution.
His only hope was that Tony would remain
inside the jail and that the detail would
not be forced to enter.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Tom turned into the place, motioning
the others to follow him, Bill’s usually optimistic
spirits fell. Tony was found pouring
over a <em class="italics">Police Gazette</em>, his chair tilted back
against the rough plaster wall.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hello, Tom,” he greeted, raising his eyes
from the pages. Then his chair came down
with a crash and he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s that feller doin’ wid you, Tom?”
he cried. “What’s he done wid Diego?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What feller? What you shoutin’ about,
Tony?” growled the barracks boss.</p>
<p class="pnext">Seeing that the game was up, Bill rested his
gun against the wall and stepped forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s me he’s talking about,” he said. “I’m
Bill Bolton.”</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id6">CHAPTER V—TAKEN FOR A RIDE</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The barracks boss stared at Bill in undisguised
amazement, while the others fingered
their rifles. Slowly a twinkle came into the
man’s eyes and he broke into a roar of laughter.</p>
<p class="pnext">“When it comes to cast-iron, dyed in the wool
<em class="italics">nerve</em>?” he choked, “you’re sure a winner, Bill—Bolton!
I took a fancy to yer when I first
laid eyes on yer and I’m sorry for yer now. If I
wasn’t,” he shot out venomously, “I’d certainly
put a bullet in yer carcass. The joke has been on
me, all right—now it’s on you. If you bumped
Diego off, the boss’ll put yer on the spot.
Them’s rules. What did yer do with him?“</p>
<p class="pnext">“He’s lying in the room over at the barracks
where he was about to handcuff me and put me
into a pair of leg irons. He’s wearing them
now, or was when I left him.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you bump him off?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No. His jaw may be broken where I socked
him—otherwise, I guess he’s O.K.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Tom took half a cigar from his pocket, thrust
it into his mouth and chewed steadily for a minute
or two.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, you’re a smart kid, Bill,” he admitted,
“but not quite smart enough for this outfit. Got
the keys to them cuffs and leg irons?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill handed over the keys without a word.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Zeppi,” Tom ordered, “trot up to the barracks.
Let that fool Diego loose and bring them
things here.” He tossed him the keys and
Zeppi hurried away.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You men,” continued Tom, “go back to
the cells with Tony and bring out them guys.
Not old man Bolton, remember. Martinengo
ain’t sendin’ him along with this batch. Take
’em out the back way and line ’em up in the road
till I come. That’s all—beat it!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Tony and the detail trooped into the corridor,
closing the door behind them. Tom ejected
a stream of tobacco juice on to the floor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t know as how I can blame yer,” he
said to Bill. “You’re in a bad way, kid, and I
reckon you know it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What about my father? Will Martinengo
have it in for him because I tried to get away?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Naw—the boss is hot on discipline, but he’ll
enjoy the joke, seeing as how nobody except
Diego is the worse for it. That mug is sure to
have a sweet time explaining but youse two
won’t get strafed. The workin’s is bad enough
punishment. He’ll let it go at that.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are these workings you’re all talking
about, Tom?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The man shook his head. “You’ll find out
soon enough,” he returned evasively. “Here
comes Zeppi. Orders is orders, and you gotta
get into that hardware.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill was handcuffed and his ankles were
locked into iron bands on either end of a short
chain. This made walking possible, but scarcely
comfortable, since he could not take a step over
a foot in length. He shuffled out of the jail,
accompanied by Tom and Zeppi, to find a group
of twelve men in chains like himself, lined up
by the roadside. Tom gave the word and the
party and its guard filed off down the road
toward the harbor.</p>
<p class="pnext">From his place at the rear of the line Bill
studied his fellow prisoners. They were a nondescript
crew, negroes, Indians (Seminoles,
from the Everglades, he thought) and poor
whites. All were dressed as he was. They were
dirty and unshaven, stumbling along quite evidently
dispirited and hopeless.</p>
<p class="pnext">The atmosphere was stifling and the white
shell dust stirred by the tramping of many feet
set them to coughing. Bill tried to show a brave
front to his guards but the utter hopelessness
of his position, the uncertain future and the
separation from his father made him feel desperately
blue and discouraged. He trudged
along in the blinding dust and heat, almost praying
that his troubles might be ended with a
bullet.</p>
<p class="pnext">But when they topped the rise and began to
follow the zig-zagging road down the cliff, the
sight of blue water below cheered him considerably.
It was cooler out of the valley, and
he somewhat regained his spirits. He spotted
his own plane, moored out in the bay near the
yacht <em class="italics">Pelican</em>. Tied up to the concrete pier was
the larger of Martinengo’s two amphibians, a
tri-motor plane of huge dimensions.</p>
<p class="pnext">The shambling party drew closer and he saw
that she was constructed with a windowed cabin
forward to house pilots and passengers. Aft of
this and having a separate entrance was a large
freight hold. When carrying a capacity load,
he fancied that her weight must be terrific.
Now, with her retractible wheel landing gear
drawn up to the metal covered hull, the big flying
boat rocked gently at her mooring. A mechanic
tinkered with her central engine. Two
young fellows in smart white uniforms and gold-banded
caps, who were smoking cigarettes on
the wharf called a greeting to Tom as the party
arrived. Bill realized that they must be pilot
and assistant pilot of this craft. A short gangway
led across from the pier to the freight cabin
entrance and over this Bridge of Sighs the clanking
prisoners were herded.</p>
<p class="pnext">The interior of this large compartment of the
air cruiser may have been originally designed
for carrying freight. Bill now found that the
remodeled hold served quite another purpose.
At right angles to the entrance, a narrow corridor
ran lengthwise down the middle of the
cabin. Opening off this were tiny wooden cubicles
with just enough space behind their barred
doors for a man to sit on the narrow bench which
served as the sole article of furniture in each
tiny cell. The place reminded Bill of the eighteenth
century prison hulks about which he had
read. Light and air were let in through iron
barred portholes and Bill was glad to find that
the cell that housed him contained one of these
small windows. By squeezing sideways on his
seat, he got a restricted view of the bay.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently the door to the prison hold was shut
and an armed guard took his seat at one end of
the cell corridor. A few minutes later, Bill
heard the engine idling and they floated away
from the dock. The hum of the three motors
soon increased to a roar and they started to taxi
toward the mouth of the harbor.</p>
<p class="pnext">Trained aviator that he was, Bill Bolton knew
the exact instant that the pilot lifted his heavy
bus on to her step. There came an increased
spurt of speed, as the plane skimmed the surface
of the bay and rose into the air with the smooth
grace of a bird taking flight.</p>
<p class="pnext">Her nose pointed toward the western horizon
she sailed over the heads at the harbor’s mouth,
gaining altitude every second. When she
reached a height which Bill, staring out of the
porthole, judged to be about a thousand feet,
her pilot banked sharply to starboard. Again
she swung back on an even keel; and now with
throttle wide open the big flying boat roared
into the northwest.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill saw that the round red orb of the sun was
perhaps still an hour above the horizon. He
craned his neck and the sea near at hand became
visible. It looked smooth and calm. Here and
there low islands, the dark green of their vegetation
contrasting with the bluish green of the
water, dotted the silken surface of the bay.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill straightened on his narrow, uncomfortable
seat. Rather than stare at the poor fellow
in the cell opposite, who was weeping, he closed
his eyes. But this did no good, for he conjured
up the dreadful picture of his father in the
stifling calaboose on Shell Island.</p>
<p class="pnext">Twisting round again, he sought relief from
troubled thought in the view from his tiny porthole.
They were traveling overland now.
Fifteen or twenty miles away, he could make
out the sea’s dim outline. But what interested
Bill far more was the nature of the country
below. Innumerable water-courses intersected
a dense cloak of dark green foliage which
seemed to be banded with a somber red along
the waterways. Then as the plane’s pilot
dropped her nose, seeking to avoid the increasingly
strong headwind, Bill caught the sickening
stench that he remembered so well.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mangrove!” he exclaimed aloud, his voice
drowned in the roar of the engines. “We’re
over the mangrove swamps of Florida, south
of the Everglades! That red line along the
banks of the streams—exposed roots, of course.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He watched the swamp for some time, wondering
what the pilot would do if a forced landing
became necessary, and thanking heaven that
the motors seemed to be running smoothly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then the amphibian sailed over wide water
again. “Whitewater Bay, on a bet,” thought
Bill, who remembered his map of Southern
Florida. “Chuck full of mangrove islands, too.
If I’m right, we’ll cross a strip of mainland
soon, and if that pilot keeps to this north-by-west
course, we’ll be over the Ten Thousand
Islands in fifteen or twenty minutes!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill’s guess was a good one. The bay gave
way to swamp once more, and then they shot out
over a weirdly beautiful stretch of water,
studded again with countless islands. He knew
now that the plane was paralleling the south-western
border of the Everglades—that huge,
swampy basin on the southern Peninsula which
covers an area much the same as Connecticut.
But unlike the populous New England state, the
only human inhabitants of the Everglades are a
few hundred Indians who thread its lonely
water-paths in primitive dugout canoes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Evidently the plane’s pilot did not intend to
cross the Everglades. They were still heading
north, but the amphibian’s nose had been swung
to starboard. By the time they left the Ten
Thousand Isles, Bill realized that they were
traveling a point or two east of north. Could it
be that they were making for those dark, watery
woodlands known as the Big Cypress?</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill had heard about the Florida Cypress
Swamps, and knew them to be a trackless labyrinth
of swamps, lagoons, creeks and low, fertile
islands, all deeply buried in the shadows of a
mighty cypress forest. Twilight was deepening
over the earth now, as the red ball of the
sun sank below the horizon. Bill thought he
could just discern the first outlines of the big
trees; then all was dark, and the amphibian
roared on into the maw of black night.</p>
<p class="pnext">He continued to gaze into the darkness. Perhaps fifteen
minutes later, his vigil was rewarded
by the sight of a pinpoint of red light
far ahead and slightly to the left of the speeding
plane. It was soon evident that the pilot recognized
this signal, far below in the wilderness.
The light disappeared from Bill’s view, and he
knew the reason why. The plane’s nose was
now headed directly for the light and therefore
it was out of range from his porthole.</p>
<p class="pnext">Down there in the trackless swamps of Big
Cypress, someone was signalling the amphibian.
Could this be their destination? Had they
reached “the workings” that the men on Shell
Island mentioned with such obvious loathing?</p>
<p class="pnext">The big bus tilted forward and down. The
three motors ceased to function and Bill knew
that the plane was about to land.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-viosceola">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id7">CHAPTER VI—OSCEOLA</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Bill was conscious of the amphibian’s upward
swing as she leveled off preparatory to
landing. Her tail dropped slightly and a second
or two later she was gliding through smooth
water propelled by her own momentum.</p>
<p class="pnext">Electric lights flashed in the prison cabin,
illuminating the place with blinding suddenness
and making it impossible to see further
into the black night outside the porthole.</p>
<p class="pnext">The plane’s momentum decreased and she
stopped with a slight jar. Orders were shouted.
Men called to each other to pull on this rope and
that. Then the door to the cabin swung open,
the prisoners trooped from their cells, and
marched up a gangway on to a large wooden
dock.</p>
<p class="pnext">Lanterns glowed in the darkness. Bill caught
a glimpse of black water, then he found himself
shuffling along a narrow corduroy road with the
rest. Great trees arched intertwining branches
overhead and cast an even deeper gloom on
their path. From time to time the swaying
lantern of a guard cast its beam on gnarled
trunks covered with creepers which reared upward
from black water. There was the rank
stench of rotting vegetation in the humid air.
Before Bill tramped the log road twenty feet,
he was wringing wet with perspiration.</p>
<p class="pnext">They swung to the right and up a sharp incline,
halting before a high stockade. Thick
plank doors in the wall of tree-trunks opened
inward and the party entered the enclosure.
Here arc lights on high wooden standards
flooded the yard with brightness. Numerous
one-story buildings were set about a large open
square of hard baked earth. So far as Bill could
see there were no trees within the stockade, nor
had any attempt been made to beautify the place.
Most of the buildings were of unpainted boards,
although the squared logs of several of the
largest proved them of more solid construction.</p>
<p class="pnext">Few people were about. The enclosure was
as bare and uninviting as a military training
camp. It was toward one of the log buildings
that the prisoners were hustled. A guard unbarred
an ironbanded door and they were thrust
within the building. With a clang the door
slammed and at last the band from Shell Island
were left to their own devices.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill looked about him. The only light came
from the arc lights’ rays which shone through
barred windows set high in the four walls. This
meager illumination cast the place into somber
twilight. Their new quarters consisted of a
not too roomy, barn-like, rectangular space, the
peak of whose slant roof was lost in the shadows
overhead. The terrific heat, the reek of perspiring
humanity added to the rank odor of the
swamp was almost overpowering.</p>
<p class="pnext">As Bill’s eyes gradually became accustomed
to the gloom, he soon discovered that the newcomers
were to have plenty of company. Dark
figures sprawled in all sorts of attitudes on the
damp earthen floor. Most of them seemed sunk
in the slumber of exhaustion. A few talked in
low tones as though the humidity had sapped all
vitality from their voices. From a dark corner
came the uncontrolled sobbing of a man in
agony.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill picked his way over the huddled bodies
toward one of the posts in the middle of the
room, that helped to support the roof. The
clanking chain that connected the ankle cuffs
impeded his progress, caught on a projection and
sent him headlong on top of another figure
crouched on the ground near the post.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sorry!” apologized Bill, hauling himself off
his victim. “I certainly didn’t—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No harm done,” replied a pleasant, though
languid voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill leaned back against the upright and
crossed his legs.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Decent of you to take it that way,” he observed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Too much effort to fight,” remarked the
unknown with surprising candor. “This beastly
place saps one’s pep. After you’ve been here a
while, you’ll feel that any unnecessary effort
just isn’t worth while. Came in just now with
that new batch, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s right—how did you guess it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re still carrying the iron-ware. Those
beasts will take it off in the morning. They
always leave you weighted down the first
night.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The man’s voice was deep and resonant. He
spoke with the accents of education which
prompted Bill to continue the conversation.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My name is Bill Bolton,” he said, by way of
a starter.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not Bolton, the Naval Academy end?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You <em class="italics">are</em> some guesser!” Bill’s tone showed
his surprise. “I made the team last fall; but
how did you happen to place me that way?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I played against you in the Carlisle game
last year. I’ve got a number now, but before
I came here I was Osceola, Chief of the Turtle
Clan of the Seminole Nation.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Carlisle’s All-American half back! I remember you
now—I should say I do. How in
the world did you get here?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Pretty much the same way we all do. I was
kidnapped. And the worst of it is that now
these devils have got us, there’s no possible
chance of escape.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What is this joint, anyway?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean you’ve no idea what you’re in
for?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not the foggiest. The men on Shell Island
spoke of ‘workings’ somewhere—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“These are the workings, Bolton—gold
workings.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But I thought I was in Big Cypress.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You are.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But—surely you can’t have a gold mine in
the middle of a swamp!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“There you’re wrong. Martinengo not only
has a gold mine, and a most profitable one, at
that—he also runs suction dredges.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How come?” Bill was intensely interested.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The rock floor of the Everglades and these
cypress swamps is usually found at a depth not
exceeding six feet; but in some places it is
twice that far down,” replied the young Seminole
chief. “There is gold in the rock below
the swamp near here. Martinengo has workings
in that rock.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Coffer dam?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, a coffer dam has been built to keep the
water out. The rock near the top is fairly soft
and that is probably why the muck on the bottom
of the swamp hereabouts contains gold.
The colors or particles of the metal run very fine,
but they are profitable to mine. At least Martinengo
finds it so. For that work suction
dredges are used. Oh, you’ll get better acquainted
with the whole business soon.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill said nothing for a minute or two. Presently
he observed: “What I don’t understand
yet, is why Martinengo kidnaps people and
keeps them prisoners in this horrible place.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Because,” Osceola answered slowly, “the
mines are made doubly profitable by using slave
labor.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What!” exploded Bill, leaning forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Slave labor, my friend. And you and I are
two of the slaves. It is cheaper for that gangster
Martinengo and his brothers to kidnap
negroes, Indians and poor whites than to hire
miners. The work is terrific and the climate
frightfully unhealthy. These devils would
have to pay a very high wage to legitimate
workmen. As it is, we don’t live long, here.
What with long working hours in a climate that
approximates a Turkish bath, the cruelty meted
out by the overseers, starvation rations, the general
filth and the hopelessness of our position—well,
two or three months of it is about as long
as the average man can stand. Swamp fever,
snake bite and other diseases usually cut the time
shorter.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s deadly.” Bill’s voice, when it came,
was very low. “And to think that this is going
on in the United States of America! Surely,
though, the government will eventually put a
stop to it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Maybe,” returned Osceola apathetically,
“but it isn’t likely that you and I will live to see
it. If the federal government has done anything
to break up organized crime that’s terrorizing
the country, I haven’t heard of it. By the
way, how did these people get hold of you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill told him, and ended by stating his worries
concerning his father.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Martinengo probably means to get money
out of Mr. Bolton before shipping him over
here. He’ll never let him go free, no matter
what he may promise. If the secret of Shell
Island ever leaks out, it means an end to Martinengo’s
profits here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Were you taken on the Island?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola laughed contemptuously. “I was
a fool, Bolton. My ambition since I was a small
boy has been to do something for my people.
Once we were great warriors, today we are a
degenerate, ignorant race. White man’s fire-water
and lack of education have made us go
backward while the rest of the world has progressed.
I meant to educate myself first, and
when I had acquired knowledge, I felt I would
then be fitted to take up my task. So I went to
school and won a scholarship at Carlisle. I still
have two more years to go there before graduation.
Shortly after the summer holidays
began this year,—I had gone back to my people—I
took my gun to bring in some waterfowl.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well to cut the tale short, I ran into a man-hunting
gang of Martinengo’s. They pretended
they were lost and I offered to lead them back to
Whitewater Bay. I suspected nothing. They
took me off guard, carted me over to Shell
Island with some other poor fellows—and eventually
I was put to work here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How long ago was that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Six weeks ago yesterday. We Seminoles
stand it better than the others. Most of us are
fever-proof, probably because we have lived in
the Everglades for generations.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Haven’t you tried to escape?” Bill asked
him, and voiced the thought that had been uppermost
in his mind ever since he left Shell
Island.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve thought about it,” the young chief admitted,
“especially when I first came here.
Everybody does, I suppose, but the thing is next
to impossible. Trackless swamp all around—it
would be sure death to face it without a boat
or canoe. And even if a craft of some kind
could be obtained, you would starve to death.
About a month ago, two men escaped but they
were caught and brought back.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Punished?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They were.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What happened to them?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Condemned to two hundred lashes apiece
with an overseer’s wirewrapped whip. We
slaves were forced to witness the—execution.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Execution!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s what it amounted to. Both of the
poor chaps were, mercifully, dead before the
first hundred lashes could be administered.
Human flesh and blood couldn’t stand it. The
whips these beasts use cut a man to ribbons. We
all get a taste of it, no matter how hard we work.
I have no shirt any more. You’ll see my back
in the morning.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For a long while the two lay there on the
filthy earthen floor without speaking. Most of
the weary souls had found a temporary relief
from their troubles in slumber. Except for the
sound of their uneven breathing the place was
still as a tomb. Through the barred windows
came the occasional sound of a splash where
some denizen of the great swamp slipped from
a gnarled root into water, and once the scream
of a bird sent echoes reverberating through the
night.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill came to a decision.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m going to take the first chance that offers,”
he whispered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Chance to escape?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, Osceola. This hopeless slavery is worth
any risk.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe you are right—but think! Even
if you can escape the guards, you will certainly
die in the swamps.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not if you will come with me?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But even I, who know the ways of swamps,
can’t guide you to safety without a canoe—and
there is absolutely no chance of securing one.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve got the germ of an idea,” said Bill, “It
still has to be worked out in detail. Also, it will,
of course, depend on whether I am put to work
on a dredge, or underground.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ll work on a dredge,” affirmed Osceola.
“We all do in this prison house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good! And I am going to put the plan to
test just as soon as I can. Tomorrow, if the
opportunity offers. <em class="italics">Will</em> you join me?” Bill’s
tone was deadly earnest.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Any death is better than this living one,” replied
Osceola in a voice that matched the
former’s.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then—it’s a go?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You bet it is!” whispered the Seminole, and
the two, after sealing the bargain with a handclasp
in the darkness, lay down again on the
hard ground and fell asleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-viithe-attempt">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id8">CHAPTER VII—THE ATTEMPT</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The first faint rays of morning filtered
through barred windows and there came a rattling
of locks on the prison-house door.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Up and out, you lazy dogs!” shouted a harsh
voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">The overseer’s whip cracked, bringing forth
a scream from a weary wretch near him.</p>
<p class="pnext">The slaves got to their feet and shuffled out
of the evil-smelling place. Two of them, however,
remained slumped on the floor. The overseer
turned them over with his foot, then realized
that these two would slave no more. He
muttered a curse and followed the others into
the square.</p>
<p class="pnext">Here under the supervision of extra guards
the slaves were drawn up in line. Bill, and the
party who had arrived with him were unshackled and
the woebegone crew was ordered
to march on again.</p>
<p class="pnext">Along the side of the square they stumbled,
halted again at an open shed where a ship’s
biscuit and a small crock of water were handed
to each man as he filed past. The line of slaves
swung round toward their prison house. Back
there once more, they sank to the ground and
partook of their morning meal. Bill noticed
that files of other slaves were being herded out
of buildings on the farther side of the square,
toward the food shed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Knock the maggots out of your biscuit and
soak it in the water,” advised Osceola, who was
seated beside him. “You won’t find it fit to eat
otherwise.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill made a grimace. “I can’t eat this filthy
stuff, Osceola. Why, it’s crawling with the
beastly things.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ll get nothing more until one o’clock
when we knock off for an hour,” returned his
friend. “And at that the ship’s biscuits are better
than the mess we get at noon. If you don’t
eat, you’ll pass out in short order. Make it
snappy, too—they don’t give us much time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded and after ridding the biscuit of
as many worms as he could find, gulped down
half of the tepid water in his crock and dunked
his breakfast in the remainder. While the
stonelike substance was softening, he studied the
young Seminole chief. By daylight, Osceola
proved to be a tall, rangy fellow, with the finely
cut features and the high cheek bones of his
race. Like most of the slaves, he wore nothing
but frayed trousers and Bill saw that his red-bronze
back was crisscrossed with ugly welts
from the lash.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the biscuit was soft enough to eat, Bill
crunched it between his teeth and forced it
down with the rest of the water. The evil mess
gagged him in spite of his hunger, but he could
not afford to starve and lose his strength. By
the time he had finished, the slave gang were
ordered to their feet again.</p>
<p class="pnext">Down to the shed they marched, and after
depositing their empty water crocks on a table,
they were crowded over to the wall of the compound.
An overseer, armed with shortstocked
whip and automatic revolver unbarred the
double doors of the stockade and swung them
inward. The guards, armed like their leader,
took their places on either side of the long line,
and two by two the slaves moved forward on to
the corduroy road.</p>
<p class="pnext">This time, instead of going down toward the
lagoon and the dock where the amphibian lay
moored, they turned off on a side road. This
wound through the swamp between great cypresses
whose dark green foliage was intertwined
with the lighter green of vines and air-plants,
and other parasites. Exposed roots of
the trees, interlocked with the roots of their
neighbors, looked like giant snakes twisting in
and out of the muck and water. Though the
sun was but half an hour high the steaming
swamp seemed to sap every ounce of Bill’s vitality,
and with it, the last shred of that hope to
which he clung so desperately. In the cavernous
gloom of the forest, the vile stench of
rotting mangrove was nearly overpowering; and
as they plodded on, the heat grew more and
more oppressive.</p>
<p class="pnext">The log roadway was never more than ten
feet wide, and sometimes, where it was built to
run between two mighty trees, it was even narrower.
It wound an uneven passage through
the swamp, until about a mile from the stockade,
it came out on a lagoon, dotted with cypress-covered
islands. Here, sunlight brightened the
long stretches of open water, and Bill saw that
lovely orchids bloomed on many of the trees,
and that the matted upper branches of the
cypresses were brilliant with masses of flowers.
Then a black blob on a root near the road uncurled
itself, one of the guards tossed a stick
and a huge snake slid into the water.</p>
<p class="pnext">The roadway extended along the lagoon’s
edge for half a mile. Though it ended abruptly
at this point, Bill saw that preparations were
in view to extend it further.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Those are the gold dredges,” affirmed Osceola,
indicating three hulks which looked like
crosses between coal barges and canal boats.
“Those big funnels at the ends, sticking into
the water, are the suction pipes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How do the dredges work?” Bill inquired
as they drew nearer.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They are driven by stationary steam engines,”
explained the young Chief. “Muck
and water are sucked up from the lagoon’s bottom,
then forced through screens and allowed
to flow in shallow streams over wide inclined
surfaces called tables. These tables are corrugated
in such a way that all heavy substances
in the silt, like fine particles of gold, are caught
in the channels and washed down on to the
blankets, while the lighter stuff passes over the
side.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“A bit too technical for me,” said Bill.
“What are blankets?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m not much on mining, but here, blankets
are just what they sound like. They are covered
with quicksilver to which the gold particles become
attached. Later the quicksilver is washed
from the blankets, and the gold taken from it
by some process I don’t know about. I may
have missed a few details—probably have. I’ve
only worked on the dredges three days.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then we aren’t <em class="italics">all</em> gold-miners?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, no. Slaves do all the work of the camp.
At present, some of the strongest of us are extending
this road farther along the lagoon. But
we’ve arrived—stop talking now, for it means
the whip, during working hours.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The line halted opposite the dredges moored
to the bank, and a certain number of the slave
gang were ordered aboard. Axes were passed
out to others, who went on board flat-boats and
poled out toward the young growths of the
cypress islands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill hoped that he would be one of this number,
for, with an axe in his hands, many things
might be possible. Instead, when his part of
the line moved up to where the head overseer
was issuing directions, the man pointed to a
stack of iron wheelbarrows. After taking an
empty barrow apiece, the two friends trundled
them in a long line of barrow men down a
planked incline to the muck heap formed by
the gold dredges. Men with shovels were already
stationed here and Bill found that with
the impetus of the guards’ whips behind them,
each man had his barrow filled with mud and
rubble in less than no time.</p>
<p class="pnext">As soon as his own was filled he trundled it
up another series of planks to the roadway.
Along this the continuous stream of sweating
barrow-pushers led him to the end of the road.
Here, under the direction of overseers, the loads
were dumped into the virgin swamp. It looked
to Bill as though the black water would swallow
up all the mud they could carry and more, but
before many trips had been completed, he could
plainly make out the progress of the roadbed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Soon the labor became a back-breaking, seemingly
endless grind. Never once was the weary,
sweating crew given a chance to rest. At the
slightest lagging, the overseer’s wirebound lash
descended upon the defenseless back of the transgressor.
Loads were heavy and the strain on
little-used muscles was terrific, especially on the
stretch of planking from the incline up to the
road. Before an hour had passed, Bill ached
in every limb. Blisters quickly formed on his
perspiring hands; he felt dizzy and sick.</p>
<p class="pnext">All at once a red hot iron seared him across
the back and shoulders, and with a yell of pain
Bill sprang forward. From behind him came
the guard’s warning:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Snap into it, y’ lazy hound—or I’ll cut your
liver out!”</p>
<p class="pnext">To retaliate would be suicidal. The man carried
an automatic besides this fearful, wirebound
cowhide lash that laid open the bare flesh
with every stroke. Bill’s anger blazed at the
cowardly blow, but at the same time his hopes
of escape sank to lowest pitch. What could
unarmed men do against these beasts? An uprising
of all the slaves would be practically an
impossibility, quartered as they were in separate
prisons. He also began to understand that even
the uprising of one prison-house gang was not
to be considered. By the end of the day, these
worn out men were sure to be apathetic to any
such proposal. The fearful punishment meted
out for failure would stop all but the most
courageous from joining a concentrated revolt
against their masters—the slim chances of success
would deter the others.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill discarded all thoughts of such a plan. If
he and Osceola were to escape, they must go it
alone. Yet how could it be accomplished? He
was still cogitating the matter, when the head
overseer raised a police whistle to his lips and
blew a sharp blast. Barrows and shovels were
immediately stacked and the men lined up for
their noonday meal.</p>
<p class="pnext">This time a greasy mess of vegetables and
small pieces of rubber-like meat were ladled on
to wooden platters from a barrel on wheels.
With this went a slab of stale bread and a crock
of water. The stew, if it could be called that,
was lukewarm and so rancid as to be almost
uneatable. But Bill wolfed it down, following
the others’ example, only sorry that no more
could be had.</p>
<p class="pnext">The gang ate their dinner squatting on the
corduroy road, and as soon as they had finished,
most of the toilers fell fast asleep.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They prepare this mess for us once a week,”
Osceola informed Bill. “Today is Thursday,
and by Saturday the heat has soured it to such
an extent that hungry as we are, we leave it
alone. No man’s stomach can hold it then.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill finished his bread and the last drop of
his water.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I should think it would pay Martinengo to
feed us better,” he muttered wearily. “No
wonder the men die off quickly, forced to such
labor and undernourished this way.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It costs him little to kidnap new slaves,”
grunted the Seminole. “All supplies have to
be flown here by plane from Shell Island. But
I’m too tired to talk, Bill. Better get what rest
you can—the afternoon is always worse than the
morning grind.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He stretched out on the logs of the roadway,
and a couple of minutes later, his regular breathing
told that he was asleep.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill lay down, too, but his aching muscles,
the smart of his back where the guard’s lash had
cut the flesh, and his blistered hands made
slumber an impossibility. Myriads of buzzing,
stinging mosquitoes added to his discomfort and
he was not sorry when the overseer’s whistle
brought the men staggering to their feet again.</p>
<p class="pnext">Instead of a wheelbarrow, now, Bill and Osceola
were given shovels for the afternoon’s
work. At first, Bill welcomed the change but
soon found that it was quite as arduous as the
morning’s toil. There was absolutely no let up.
As soon as one barrow was filled, another took
its place. The wet mud was slippery, the mosquitoes
by the water even more tenacious. He
began to feel that death was preferable to endless
days of this kind of thing.</p>
<p class="pnext">To make matters even worse, the overseer
in charge of the shovelers used his lash without
mercy at the first sign of flagging. Bill felt its
burning pain several times during those hours,
as did every other man on the muck-heap.</p>
<p class="pnext">The woodcutters returned late in the afternoon
and began carting their logs up the incline
where they were dumped on the mud at the end
of the corduroy to solidify the foundation of
the extended roadway. The tree trunks were
heavy and the men so weak that it took eight or
ten of them to carry a single log.</p>
<p class="pnext">Slowly the sun sank toward the western end
of the lagoon and Bill knew that within five or
ten minutes they would be forced to knock off
for want of light. Then Osceola slipped in the
muck and fell flat.</p>
<p class="pnext">Before the poor youth could get to his feet,
the overseer’s lash felled him again. But instead
of desisting in his cruelty, the man continued to
rain blows on the prostrate and half-unconscious
body of the Indian.</p>
<p class="pnext">This was too much for Bill. As the wicked
lash descended for the third time, he dashed
toward the guard and swinging his shovel like a
club, brought it down on the man’s skull. The
overseer dropped in his tracks and Bill helped
Osceola to his feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Follow me,” he shouted, “it’s now or
never!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola, half dazed, ran with him through
the crowd of amazed workmen to the far edge
of the muck heap. There came two splashes
as the lads dove. Revolvers barked, men shouted
orders and the lagoon’s glassy surface was
churned with bullets.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-viiiwhat-happened-in-the-swamp">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id9">CHAPTER VIII—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SWAMP</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The water closed over Bill’s head. The
shock of the plunge put new heart into him and
he struck vigorously out keeping well under the
surface. His plan was to make for one of the
small islands of the lagoon, trusting that oncoming
darkness would cover his escape. What
he would do after reaching the island must
depend upon circumstances.</p>
<p class="pnext">The green depths of the lake were surprisingly
clear. He could see myriads of small
fish dart away as he forged ahead. Then a
long dark body swept alongside of him.
Osceola’s sinewy arm caught him by the
shoulders and swung him round to the left.
The Indian swam ahead, keeping parallel with
the bank, his actions showing Bill that he
wished him to follow.</p>
<p class="pnext">By this time, Bill’s lungs were nearly bursting
and his head throbbed with the strain of
remaining under water. Feeling that he must
have air or drown, he turned on his back and
rose, careful that no more than his nose and
mouth appeared above the surface. Two or
three life-giving breaths, and he sank again,
with the muffled sound of revolver shots in his
ears. After another spurt under water in the
direction indicated by Osceola, he came up to
the surface again, sinking as soon as he had filled
his lungs with air.</p>
<p class="pnext">Rising for the third time, he was surprised to
find the young Seminole at his side. Osceola
was floating with his head just above the water.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s safe to stay up now,” he murmured.
“Make no sound—and follow me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Indian turned on his side and glided forward
with the speed and silence of an otter.
Bill understood that a splash might be fatal in
advertising their whereabouts, and followed in
his wake. Though a strong swimmer and a
fast one, he could not keep up with the Chief.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then the sun, already low on the horizon,
sank out of sight. Osceola’s sleek head disappeared
under the canopy of overhanging
boughs that lined the lagoon’s swampy shore.
Soon Bill glided beside him, into the deep
shadow under the branches, and although he
could not see his friend, he heard his low voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Give me your hand, Bill. We’ve got to
get out of this. They will come here when
they find no sign of us in the lagoon.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Lead on, old sport,” answered the white
youth. “You’re a better man than I am if you
can navigate in this gloom.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, I’ve got eyes like a cat,” chuckled
Osceola. “Come on now—there are roots below
us—stand on them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill found a foothold on the slimy roots and
hand in hand they scrambled out of the water.
Osceola led him round the base of a huge tree
and onto the sprawling roots of another forest
giant.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is the one—I’ve had my eye on it
ever since we’ve been working this end of the
lagoon. There’s a cleft in the trunk, about
thirty feet up that will hold us nicely.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mmm—after we get there!” was Bill’s
unenthusiastic reply.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, that’s not so difficult. There are plenty
of vines.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill followed Osceola a few steps round the
trunk, then felt his hand touch a thick stem
that clung to the bark of the tree.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Follow that straight up,” directed the
Seminole. “I’ll go ahead, for I can see.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I wish I could,” said Bill. “I’m as blind as
a bat in this darkness!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ll get accustomed to it,” Osceola assured
him. Then Bill’s hand was released from
the Indian’s grasp and he heard the other moving
upward. “Follow me,” he went on, when
he was just above Bill’s head, “and if you get
into trouble, grab my foot until you can find a
toehold.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The thick stem of the vine proved a comparatively
easy means of ascent, and especially
so to an Annapolis midshipman. Up he went,
hand over hand, his rubber-soled shoes gripping
the bark’s rough surface.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here we are,” said Osceola’s soft voice
presently, “give me a hand—that’s right. Now
step in here and squat down. Not so bad, eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Could be a lot worse,” agreed Bill, finding
a seat next to his friend in the wide cleft. “If
those guys can’t see any better than I can in this
murk, they’ll have a time locating our hideout.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’ll have torches to give them all the
light they need,” replied Osceola. “But they’re
not counting on their eyes to find us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Listen!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Across the swamp sounded the deep bay of a
dog.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bloodhounds?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They keep four of the brutes in kennels
over at the stockade.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Think they’ll be able to track us?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I doubt it. We were walking on roots under
water until we started to climb. Of course we
left a trail up the tree trunk, but the hounds
are not likely to scent it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then you think we’re O.K. for a while?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We can’t stay here forever. When daylight
comes, the guards can spot us easily from the
end of the road. This tree isn’t more than
thirty yards from there.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The question being—where do we go from
here?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, where do we go! We’ve got neither
food nor a boat. What with snakes, alligators
and other pleasant companions, we won’t get
very far on a hike through the swamps. You
spoke of a plan some time ago. How about it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just a germ of one,” sighed Bill. “It needs
working out—but with luck you and I will be
able to get away from this vile place and go
pretty much where we like. It all hangs on
whether we can—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hush!” warned Osceola. “They’re coming
this way. Look over your shoulder!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill did more than that. He twisted round
in the niche and stared into the black opaqueness
toward the corduroy road.</p>
<p class="pnext">Lights, twinkling pinpoints of red, dotted
the black night in wavering clusters which advanced
along the road. And again the damp,
lifeless air was burdened with the deep-throated
cry of bloodhounds.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Those lights will discover us if the searching
party leaves the road and comes over this
way,” whispered Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There’s only one thing to do,” admitted his
companion. “And we’d better do it now.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Crawl out on one of these branches and lie
flat. You take that one nearest you and I’ll lie
on the one that parallels it. Don’t move if
they come underneath us. Some of those guards
have ears like their hounds.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill had no difficulty in performing this
feat, for the branch was thicker than his own
body and he wriggled along until he lay fifteen
or twenty feet from the trunk of the tree. His
eyes had at last grown used to the inky darkness
of this forest in the swamp. Peering down
through the heavy screen of foliage and vines,
the gnarled roots, underbrush and stagnant
water below became dimly visible. To the
left, possibly ten feet away and slightly above
him, was the branch on which his Indian friend
lay. Of Osceola he could see nothing, but he
heard the Seminole’s muffled warning as he
twisted his body to get a better view and in doing
so, cracked a twig.</p>
<p class="pnext">The lights of the searching party were steadily
moving nearer. For a few minutes they
seemed to hesitate at the spot where the road
ended. Then they came on again and he could
plainly hear the dogs splashing noisily about in
the swamp. Still nearer—and the glare of pine
torches made it possible for Bill to see that the
party were poling canoes—three of them.
The flares lit up the swamp, sending weird
shadows here and there as the canoes advanced.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Them dogs is tryin’ t’ climb in this here
canoe,” sang out a rough voice. “There ain’t
no scent on th’ water fer them t’ follow.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let’s go back, Pete,” argued another voice,
“if dose guys is in dis swamp dey’ll have t’ stay
put till mornin’. Den we can catch ’em easy.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sez you!” returned Pete with a snort. Bill
recognized his surly voice as that of the overseer
he had felled with his shovel. “Them two
can see in daylight just the same as us. An’ one
of ’em is an Indian, don’t forget. They’s round
here somewhere now an’ with sunup, they’ll
hike it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yeah?” sneered the other. “They
ain’t got no boat nor grub. What’s de use of
rustlin’ in here now, Pete? Them hounds ain’t
no good. What we need is water-rats.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Shut yer trap—and step on it with dat
pole!” Pete’s ire seemed to be at the boiling
point. “Long as I’m bossing this job, we goes
on—see? You bums is pushin’ yer faces into
de wrong picture when yer bumps up against
me. Scram now—an’ <em class="italics">shut yer traps</em>!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill held his breath. The canoes were now
directly underneath the spreading branch of the
cypress where he and Osceola lay hidden. He
hugged the limb close, praying that the blazing
flares below would not disclose his whereabouts
to the trackers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly a sharp hiss sounded in his ear.
Thinking that Osceola wished to attract his attention,
he turned his head toward the neighboring
branch. To his horror he saw a huge snake
lower its long black body from the branch above.
The reptile’s furiously hissing head was not over
a foot from his face. Disturbed by the lights,
the angry creature was bent on attack!</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill clung frozen to his branch. If he moved,
the men beneath the tree would be attracted by
the sound, and would probably sight him at
once. Far better a swift death in the gloom of
the cypress than slow torture for Osceola as
well as himself if they were discovered.</p>
<p class="pnext">All this shot through his mind with the speed
of light. Then a branch cracked, there came a
swishing sound through the air and the snake
slid downward, missing him by inches. He saw
Osceola draw back the stick with which he had
lashed the moccasin, and the air was rent with
a terrified scream from below.</p>
<p class="pnext">Peering down, Bill saw a horror which he
would never forget. Twined around Pete’s
throat and head was the viper that a moment
before had nearly caused his own death. The
frenzied overseer leapt shrieking to his feet and
lurched into the water. The canoe capsized and
its two other occupants were precipitated into
the swamp with their leader.</p>
<p class="pnext">For several minutes, bedlam reigned. Dogs
barked, men shouted hoarsely, their yells
awakening the forest birds whose cries of alarm
echoed and reechoed throughout the night.</p>
<p class="pnext">Pete’s companions splashed aimlessly about
in the muck and water for a time, then with the
help of the other two crews, their canoe was
righted and they climbed aboard. The overseer’s
body did not come to the surface.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Youse guys can do what yer like,” declared
one of the dripping men when the uproar had
subsided, “Me——I’ve had enough. I’m
goin’ back.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m wid ye,” agreed a voice from one of the
other canoes. “Let’s fish Pete out an’ go
home.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Say! If youse expects me ter wade round
in this muck, lookin’ fer a stiff, wid dat snake
ready ter bite and plenty more of ’em in dis here
swamp, youse got another think comin’——”
snarled the first man with profane emphasis.
“Dis baby’s goin’ to catch some sleep before
sunup—er somebody else is goin’ on de spot
‘long wid Pete. Hey dere, bozo—turn dis boat
round. I want t’ get me feet on solid ground
again before sumpin else falls outen de trees ter
croak a guy!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Grunts and shouts of approval greeted this
lengthy speech. The canoes headed back toward
the road. The trackers, by common consent,
were through for the night.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the lights of the party had disappeared
in the distance, Osceola spoke to Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Come back to the niche on the trunk. Those
chaps are off till morning. We’ve got to plan,
now.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill scrambled backward along his limb, and
found Osceola before him at their perch. He
grasped the young Indian’s hand and wrung it.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You saved my life, Osceola! I thought I
was a goner. Some day perhaps I may be able
to show you that I appreciate what you did for
me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, that’s all right!” Osceola’s voice
showed his embarrassment. “And you did more
than that for me on the muck heap this afternoon.
Pete’s out for good now—and I must
confess I’m not sorry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here, too.—You spoke of plans just now.
Got any?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not a single idea—but what about yours?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I was tired and sleepy a while back.
Couldn’t think. But that snake woke me up—and
how!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are you thinking of?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That we wait here for an hour—then hike
over to the compound.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But—you mean—to give ourselves up?”
Osceola cried in astonishment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Give ourselves up—nothing! I’m going to
get us out of this rotten cypress swamp for good
and all. But to get away from here we’ve got
to go back there first.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola grunted. “What you are saying
probably means something to you—to me it is
as plain as mud. Sounds like a minstrel gag.
Tell me, Mr. Bones, when and why we must go
in there in order to get out of here!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill laughed for the first time since his
arrival at the workings.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re a sketch, Osceola! But I guess
you’re right. My plan in a nut-shell is just this.
You may not believe me, but if we live, you and
I are going out of here by plane—and I’m going
to fly it. Do you see now?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The amphibian is here, all right,” affirmed
the Seminole. “She won’t fly back to Shell
Island until tomorrow. But there’s no stealing
her, young fellow. First, she’s locked up tight.
Second, she’s too well guarded.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just so,” Bill declared, grinning in the darkness.
“But my plan is not to steal the <em class="italics">plane</em>,
you know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What then?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Steal the pilots, my hearty!” This time Bill
laughed outright.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-ixwhat-happened-in-the-compound">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id10">CHAPTER IX—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COMPOUND</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“How about it?” asked Bill an hour later.
“Time to travel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I guess those lads behind the stockade should
be pretty well off to bye-bye by this time,”
yawned Osceola, getting stiffly to his feet. “In
more ways than one, I hate to leave the shelter
of this good old tree. It certainly has proved a
help in time of need!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill likewise stood up and balanced himself
on their airy perch in the darkness. “Well, I
can see your point,” he answered, “but I’m not
getting sentimental about it. Ever since that
filthy snake poked his nose at me, I’ve been
waiting for his wife or brother or sister to drop
on me. I can’t see in the dark like you. So the
sooner we make the road, the happier I’ll be.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Notwithstanding the urge that prompted Bill
to hasten, it took the two some time to reach the
corduroy road. Osceola took the lead. He
seemed to have no trouble in discerning obstacles
quite invisible to Bill. At the base of the tree,
he caught his white friend’s hand, and after a
few words of caution, started forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">To Bill the trip seemed endless. They had
not gone far when he lost all sense of direction.
Along slimy roots, first above and then below
water, they made their way. It was impossible
to pierce the inky shadow under the trees. If
it had not been for Osceola’s uncanny power,
half instinct, half sight, Bill would have
floundered into the soft mud of the swamp and
been sucked down into the ooze. How long the
journey took, Bill could never figure out when
later he thought about it. The actual distance
was not great, but the time taken to travel it
seemed years.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here we are,” exclaimed Osceola at last.
“Step on to that log, and be careful. It runs up
the side of the dump at the end of the road.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill felt with his foot in the darkness, touched
one of the tree trunks thrown down to act as road
ballast. A scramble up the steep incline followed,
the Indian still guiding him by the hand,
and they were standing on the corduroy.</p>
<p class="pnext">They were now no longer under the forest
canopy and above their heads the heavens were
studded with stars. Without a word, the youths
broke into a trot. Fifty yards from the stockade
gates they halted. There came a whispered
conference, and then two dark figures entered
the shadow cast by the trees and crawled forward
along the roadside.</p>
<p class="pnext">Just before they reached the gates they turned
to the right. Following the log wall, they continued
to creep on until they arrived midway
between two of the flood lights which illuminated
the compound. These were placed on
high poles, perhaps ten feet above the twelve-foot
stockade.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill grasped more firmly the short, thick
stick he carried, and placed his mouth close to
Osceola’s ear. “Lucky Martinengo never
thought that prisoners might want to get <em class="italics">into</em>
this place, rather than break out of it,” he
whispered. “If those lights faced this way,
we’d sure be out of luck.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Seminole grunted a low assent.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Stand with your back to the wall,” Bill continued,
“and give me a hand up. When the
guard comes along, I’ll bean him with this club.
Then I’ll pass him over to you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay. But after you drop him over, get
on this side of the wall again, while I’m tying
him up with the creepers. One of those devils
inside is likely to spot you, otherwise.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good idea—I’ll do that. Ready?”</p>
<p class="pnext">For, answer, Osceola got to his feet and
walked over to the stockade. Here he turned,
placed his back against the wall and made a
stirrup of his clasped hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stuck the club into his waistband and a
moment later was standing on his friend’s broad
shoulders. Up went his hands and he chinned
himself to the top of the wall. A broad sentry-bench
ran along the inside of the stockade.
Lounging with his back to the logs, sat a guard,
every feature of his unpleasant face made plain
by the blazing floodlights.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill lowered himself onto Osceola’s shoulders
and leaned forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">“He’s sound asleep!” he whispered tensely.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Fine. We’ll leave him alone, then. Get
an arm over the top and stand by for my weight
when I hoist myself up.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill obeyed and the Indian caught his leg.
Then came a moment of severe strain—and
Osceola clung to the wall at his side.</p>
<p class="pnext">Up and over they went together. Bare feet
touched the sentry-bench, tiptoed to the edge
and the lads disappeared beneath it. They had
reached their first objective in less than two
minutes.</p>
<p class="pnext">Safe for the moment from outside observation,
Bill followed Osceola as the young Indian
skirted the wall in the deep shadow below the
sentry-bench. No word was spoken. Each
knew exactly what he must do, and kept his
mind focussed on that performance. True, the
first part of their plan was working out far
better than they had expected, but the second
and third stages of their enterprise were far
more dangerous. Although they were elated by
their success so far, neither was overconfident.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola stopped short and pointed to a building
that stood possibly twenty yards away.
Smaller than most of the houses, it was a bungalow,
with wide verandas extending round the
entire structure. It was shingled, and topped
with a low-eaved roof of attractive green tiles.
The contrast between this comfortable-looking
dwelling and the barn-like quarters of the slaves
was as pronounced as day and night, or the contrast
between home and prison. Bill had not
slept in a comfortable bed for some time. Then
and there he determined to finish out the rest
of the night in that bungalow!</p>
<p class="pnext">Between the sentry-bench and the house there
was no shelter of any kind. Floodlights
streamed down on the hardbaked clay of the
compound, bringing every rut or small unevenness
of the surface into clear relief. Moreover,
the ground was within the direct line of vision
of the sentries.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do we crawl—or make a dash for it?”
hissed Osceola.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The sooner, the quicker. We’re more likely
to attract attention moving fast, but we’re
harder to hit!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Seminole nodded. “Ready if you are.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let’s go!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Together they sprinted across the open space.
Each moment Bill expected the drilling pain of
a rifle bullet between his shoulders, and it took
considerable will power not to crouch and
slacken his pace. Their naked feet made no
sound at all on the hard earth and rather less
than a second later, the two vaulted the veranda
railing and sank down behind it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Certain that so far their presence within the
compound had not been discovered, Bill got to
his feet again. With Osceola at his heels, he
crossed the piazza to a screened door, pulled it
open and entered the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">They found themselves in a kitchen where a
gas stove stood in one corner, across from a large
sink. Polished pans and cooking pots hung below
long shelves stacked with cans of food,
packages of cereal and the like.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Too bad we can’t help ourselves to a meal,”
whispered Osceola. “I’m famished, aren’t
you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sure am. But come on now, when we’ve
finished the job ahead, it will be time to think
of food. I prefer starving a bit longer—it’s one
better than dying by the lash! Through that
door is our way. Quiet! if those lads in there
wake up before we want them to, you and I are
out of luck.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola opened the door indicated by Bill
and they slipped through it, closing it softly
behind them. They were now in a hall which
ran forward bisecting this part of the house.
There were two open doors on their left. Bill
pointed to the nearer and they tiptoed to the sill.</p>
<p class="pnext">Thin rays from the floodlights filtered in
through half open blinds. By this dim light
Bill and Osceola made out the figure of a man
sprawled on a cot by the window. A small
bureau, two straight chairs, a wardrobe trunk
and grass matting on the floor completed the
room’s furnishings. On one of the chairs lay a
small pile of clothes; on the other, close to the
head of the bed was an automatic revolver and
a gold-faced watch.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola passed like a shadow across the intervening
space and grasped the gun. Bill closed
the door to the hall. Neither made the slightest
sound. Then Bill nodded to his friend.
Osceola promptly kicked the side of the cot and
the sleeper awoke to find himself looking into
a blue-black muzzle.</p>
<p class="pnext">“One peep out of you and I’ll blow your head
off!” remarked the Indian in a low, dispassionate
voice. “Turn on your face and put your
hands behind your back.”</p>
<p class="pnext">A single glance into his captor’s eyes was
enough for the fellow on the bed. Those
smoldering fires of pent-up hate won the battle
before it was begun. The young man hastened
to comply with instructions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill came over to the bed and while Osceola
continued to cover their prostrate prisoner with
the automatic, he tore a sheet into long strips.
With these the fellow on the bed was scientifically
bound and gagged. Then the two friends
moved on to the next room.</p>
<p class="pnext">In there, exactly the same thing happened.
Ten minutes after entering the bungalow, Bill
and his Seminole friend were masters of the
place.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t suppose this house has a cellar,”
mused Bill. They were in the kitchen, preparing
a much needed meal.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not a chance,” said Osceola, from the stove.
“You’ll strike water a foot down anywhere in
this compound. Haven’t you got those cans of
corned beef open? This skillet is piping hot.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill tossed him the cans, placed a bowl of
eggs within reach of the cook and commenced
to slice bread.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I asked, because we’ve got to stow those
aviators somewhere. Perhaps the joint runs to
an attic. That will do just as well.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, we’ll find a good place for them,”
replied the Seminole, intent on his cooking.
“Confound them! These aviators of Martinengo’s
live like kings. A house to themselves,
all kinds of good things to eat, and we poor
devils pigging it a stone’s throw away!—Better
break open some more of those cans. I see
tomatoes, corn, asparagus and cherries on that
shelf. Let’s sample them all. I haven’t had a
decent meal, let alone half enough to eat for
weeks. How about it? Have you got an appetite?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“<em class="italics">Have</em> I!” Bill began opening the other cans
and dumping their contents on plates which he
placed on the kitchen table. “I’ll tell you one
thing and that is, we eat the rest of this as is. I
can’t wait for cooking. Bring over that skillet
of eggs and corned beef. I’ll get the coffee.
The smell of this stuff has turned me ravenous!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Half an hour later, the two lads drained the
last dregs of their coffee and grinned sleepily
at each other across the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Some feed!” Bill yawned and raised his
arms above his head. “I bet we’ve got away
with three days’ rations. Gosh! One more
crumb and I’ll bust! Do you think it’s safe,
now, to turn in? I could go to sleep standing
up.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola rose slowly to his feet. “Of course
it’s safe, Bill. I wouldn’t take a chance—not
at this stage of the game, you know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But how about the lad who cooks for our
aviator-friends? He’ll mosey along here in the
morning, and when he finds <em class="italics">us</em> sleeping here,
there’ll be the devil to pay!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, no, there won’t! I know the man who
acts as their servant, luckily enough. He’s a
sort of trusty—been here a long time—but he
is locked up in our prison house every night.
That chap is just as keen to get back to his home
and his people as we are. There won’t be a peep
out of Sam. Our worries will begin again when
we leave this place in the morning——But
sufficient unto the day——”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good enough!” enthused Bill, also leaving
the table. “That being the case, I vote we put
the careless aviators in a good safe place. Then
me for bye-bye P.D.Q.!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you think,” grinned Osceola, “that <em class="italics">I’m</em>
going to stay up and wash dishes ...” he
yawned, “you’ve got see-vee-rial thinks coming!”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xwhat-happened-in-the-morning">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id11">CHAPTER X—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MORNING</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“Eight o’clock, suh! A fine hot day—an’
yo’ baf is runnin’.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill opened his eyes and stared upward from
a soft pillow into the grinning face of an ancient
negro.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ise Sam. Reckon Marse Osceola done tell
yo’all ‘bout me. Yessuh—yo’ baf is runnin’.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stretched and sat up in bed. “Pinch me,
Sam,” he yawned. “Did you really say ‘bath’—or
am I still sound asleep?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, suh, yo’ sure is awake, Marse Osceola
has just got out o’ the tub. He done tol’ me to
wake yo’all.” The old darkey seemed a bit
flustered. “Ef yo’ll kindly tell me how yo’ likes
yo’ eggs, Marse Bolton, I’ll go on in de kitchen
and dish up breakfast.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sam,” said Bill, springing out of bed.
“You’re a sight for sore eyes, and your voice is
music. Lead me to that bath you mentioned,
and lead me quick. Real soap and clean water!
Gee—it’s wonderful!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ de eggs, suh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As long as they are fresh and there’s plenty
of them, you cook them any way your heart
desires.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yessuh——I will, suh. De bathroom’s
through dat door over yonder.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Thirty minutes later, two spruce young fellows
in freshly laundered uniforms of white
duck met at the breakfast table in the dining
room of the bungalow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Is it really the wild Seminole chief,
Osceola?” grinned Bill as he stood and gazed
admiringly at his friend.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola grinned back at him. “It sure is,”
he laughed and took his seat at the table.
“They tell me that clothes don’t make the
man, but—well, I’d never have known you for
the chap I said good night to a few hours ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I feel like a million dollars!” Bill unfolded
a snowy white napkin, while Sam filled
his coffee cup. “Rest, good food and decent
clothes, not to speak of a bath, sure do make a
difference. These uniforms fit as if they’d
been built for us, too.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola nodded. “These white shoes I’ve
got on pinch a bit, but even so, I’m probably a
darn sight more comfortable than the lad who
owns them. It must be getting pretty hot under
the roof by this time.” He motioned toward the
ceiling.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’ll be found and released later on,”
said Bill, his mouth full of buttered toast. “In
fact, I’ll leave a note on the table here, when we
go, telling where we’ve hidden them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They don’t deserve it,” returned Osceola,
“but you’re the boss. Do as you like about it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What time is the plane scheduled to shove
off?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She generally takes the air about ten. We’ve
plenty of time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“O.K. We’ll finish breakfast, then I’ll write
the note, and we’ll go down to the dock. I want
to get to the plane early. A helmet and goggles
for each of us will be a grand help to this disguise.
What’s worrying me is the getting
down there. If the guard at the gate happens
to know those lads upstairs, and smells a rat,
things are likely to become rather unpleasant.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They are,” said Osceola with conviction.
“If we are stopped, there’s nothing for it but
to shoot our way out and beat it down to the
plane. Maybe we’ll make it and maybe we
won’t—— Anyway, we’ll have lived like
human beings again for a few hours—and
that’s something!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re right there, old man!” Bill pushed
back his chair. “Come in here, Sam,” he
called. Then as the darkey appeared through
the swinging door, “How’d you like to take a
hop, Sam?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, suh,—if you on’y could take me with
you!” The old man’s voice was husky with
excitement and longing.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If we go, you go,” declared Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“God’ull bless yo’all for dis, Marse Bolton.
‘Deed he will. I done give up all hope o’ seein’
Lize an’ de chilluns long ago. I——”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stood up and clapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s all right, uncle. If things go as we
hope, we’ll all be seeing our folks soon. Go
into the room I slept in. There’s a suitcase in
there, and there’s one in the other bedroom, too.
Pack them with anything you please, and follow
us down to the dock with both bags when we
leave here. Carry them aboard the plane and
forget to come ashore. I’ll find a place you can
stow away, never fear.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He cut short the old darkey’s thanks and sent
him hurrying off to pack. Then, after rummaging
about, he found paper and pencil. A
moment or two later he tossed the note he had
written on to the table, for Osceola to read.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t suppose there’s much of a chance
we’ll have the bus to ourselves?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hardly. She only runs three times a week
and from what I’ve heard, there are always
passengers to be taken to Shell Island. Where
will you head for?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Miami, I guess. Any town with a police
station and a jail for our passengers! But Dad
and I have slews of friends in Miami, and we
may need friends badly before we’re clear of
this business. How does that suit you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s as good a spot to land as another. I
want to see this place and Shell Island cleaned
out before I go home.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just one thing more, Osceola.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If there’s trouble aboard the amphibian—with
the passengers, I mean—well—I’m not
coming back unless I can bring a posse.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ll crash her first?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just that—agree?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course I agree to it. I’d a thousand times
rather be dead than live the life of the last few
weeks over again. If there’s no other way out,
crash her. That’s a quick end—but to be
brought back here means death by inches for
both of us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam appeared in the doorway, carrying a
couple of suitcases. “I’se all ready, gennulmen,
when yo’all is.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That being the case,” smiled Bill, “my vote
goes for a speedy departure. Ready, Osceola?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Rearing to go.” He picked up his gold
braided cap and clapped it on his head. “It
always sets me on edge to wait—for danger.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“So you rush into battle so as to get it over
with, eh?” Bill laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Something like that. To tell the truth, I
think we’re both just a bit beyond ourselves at
present. Let’s get out of here.” He walked to
the front door and flung it open.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill caught up his cap and followed Osceola,
with Sam at his heels.</p>
<p class="pnext">Sun from the cloudless sky poured down on
the unlovely prospect before them in a deluge of
steaming, tropical heat. The compound, except
for a mangy cur or two and a remarkably thin
cat, was deserted. The members of Martinengo’s
company who were not driving his slaves
in the swamp preferred the shade afforded by
their quarters rather than this blistering sunlight.
Presently the little party came to the
closed gates of the stockade.</p>
<p class="pnext">A man shambled out of the guardhouse with
a huge key in his hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Youse high-flyers certainly have the life,”
he grumbled and rattled the padlock that held
the gates. “Nuthin’ ter do but take nice breezy
rides and have niggers to wait on you. And me
sweatin’ blood ter let you in and out of this
here stockade!”</p>
<p class="pnext">He pushed open the heavy doors just far
enough for one man to pass through at a time,
stood aside and scowled at them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“So much obliged, Oswald, old chap,”
beamed Bill. “Sorry I’ve got nothing smaller
than a demi-grand. Sam, if the worthy turn-key
insists on a tip, hand him a cake of soap.
He’ll smell the sweeter for it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He passed out of the stockade behind Osceola,
with Sam grinning from ear to ear, bringing up
the rear. Through the closing gates came a
torrent of sizzling invective.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Kind of risky, wasn’t it, Bill?” The Seminole
waited for his white friend, then paced
beside him down the winding corduroy road.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill grinned. “Maybe,” he admitted. “But
he seemed to expect an exchange of courtesies.
He’s used to getting an earful from the pilots,
I’ll bet. And returning it with interest, for that
matter. Well, here we are at the dock—and
there’s the old bus waiting for us!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And nobody around yet but our own sweet
selves!” exulted his friend. “But I’m a blushing
rose today when it comes to showing my
lovely phiz. Me for a helmet and goggles as
soon as possible. Let’s get aboard.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They slid back the door to the cabin and
passed inside. The long apartment was equipped
with comfortable passenger seats, five on each
side of the narrow central aisle. Big observation
windows ran the length of the cabin, and
a door at the rear led direct to the prison hold
in which Bill had made the trip from Shell
Island. Investigation proved that the wooden
bars of the cells had been removed and piled at
the farther end. Neatly stacked in bins arranged
for the purpose were a goodly number of
small canvas sacks. Each bag was padlocked.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill lifted one of the sacks. “Gold!” he
cried. “Nothing else could be so heavy. The
Martinengos certainly are making a fortune out
of these diggings if this is a sample shipment!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’ll not get a chance to lay their filthy
paws on that lot if I can help it,” said Osceola
grimly. “Let’s go up front. I haven’t seen
a hole a mouse could hide in so far, much less
Sam. Perhaps that door with the window in it,
at the other end of the passenger cabin will solve
the problem.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I can tell you now that it opens into the
pilot’s cockpit.” Bill started forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">Upon reaching it, he slid open the door to
find himself in a roomy cockpit, fitted with two
pilots’ seats and complete dual control of the
wheel and column type. A three piece glass
windshield gave such protection that Bill knew
goggles would not be necessary under normal
flying conditions.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s a swell boat,” he remarked. “Luxurious
devils, these slave drivers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola nodded. “Looks pretty nice to me.
Certainly is a big ship. Do you know anything
about her? I mean to say, can you fly this kind
of an airplane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill smiled good humoredly at the Seminole’s
worried expression. “This bus is a tailor-made
job—no stock model was ever built like this.
But I can fly her all right, once I’ve seen that
her tanks are full and tested her three engines.
The man who assembled this ship knew what
he was doing. There’s nothing better for commercial
work than the 200 horsepower, air-cooled
radial engines she’s equipped with.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll take your word for it, old man. But
why not get busy and take off right now? If
there are any passengers, they’re likely to spot
us for what we are. I’m not eager to shirk a
fight, you know, but things are sure to become
hectic when they find out we’re not bound for
Shell Island.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“True,” said Bill. “But I reckon we’ve got
to go through with it. Your idea’s a good one,
Osceola, but it just won’t work. I thought of
the same thing on the way down here. Cast
your eye yonder, old sport. Martinengo’s minions
are taking no chances with pilots pulling
anything phoney on their own hook!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Both Osceola and old Sam glanced in the direction
indicated by Bill. On a broad mound
of earth, half way up the incline toward the
stockade, the ugly nose of a field gun could be
plainly seen, Beside the gun stood a sentry.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That gun would blow this bus to kingdom
come if I ‘got busy’—as you call it. I’m going
to give the ship a looking-over now, but that’s
all, till I get word to shove off.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola’s face was a study in chagrin and
gloom.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re right, of course, Bill. I’d forgotten
about that gun. Tell me—what are we going
to do with Sam?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, he can stay in this cockpit. Crawl in
behind the pilot’s seat, Sam. Lie down on the
deck, and curl up so your legs don’t show. The
partition will screen you from the passengers.
Better hop in there now—there’s no telling
when they’ll be along.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yassuh, boss, Ise a-gwine dar now. I ain’t
takin’ no chances.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam wriggled into his hideaway and Bill
turned to Osceola.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Slip into that jumper and put on your helmet,”
he suggested. “It looks no end professional.
There’s nothing for you to do but sit in
that seat. You can’t very well put down your
goggles until just before the take off. So if anyone
shows curiosity, pretend to be fixing something
on the instrument board. You’ll find a
screwdriver in the locker, I guess. That ought
to help the picture fifty percent at least,” he
grinned, then went on—“But if you love your
life, don’t unscrew or tighten anything! There
are some men coming down the road now. I’ve
got an inspection to make and then—I’ve got to
get out on the dock and meet them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Can’t you stick around here, get the motors
started or something?” Osceola’s voice was
muffled by the jumper he was pulling over his
head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I'd like to,” Bill assured him. “But it would
look queer and somebody would be sure to smell
a rat. There’ll be a guy down here to give me
orders, all right. From what we know, the
pilots of this outfit keep pretty much to themselves.
Here’s hoping I don’t run into any of
their pals.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve got my gun handy, and you’re wearing
one,” said Osceola pointedly, as he adjusted the
chinstrap of his helmet. “If it comes to a pinch,
we’ll shoot it out—field gun or no field gun.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s the way to talk!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill slapped his friend’s shoulder and went
into the cabin.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xiwhat-happened-in-the-air">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id12">CHAPTER XI—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE AIR</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Then there came the sound of tramping on
the wooden planks of the dock. Bill took a
deep breath and stepped out of the cabin into
the bright sunshine. He counted seven—seven
men approaching him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Morning,” he greeted affably as the leaders
drew near. “All passengers?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“All but me—fer the island,” announced the
man in advance of the rest, a cadaverous person
with a Vermont twang in his voice. “I got too
much to do round here to go joy ridin’. Guess
I ain’t seen you before. Funny, but I thought
Thompson piloted the plane up last night.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not this plane, Mr.—?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Weed’s my name, youngster. Who be ye
anyway?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill smiled at the matter-of-fact Mr. Weed.
“First pilot of this amphibian,” he answered
calmly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Several of the other men chuckled. “That’s
one fer ye,” exploded one, “what’s his moniker
matter, so’s he can fly the plane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s my business,” growled the Vermonter.
“Shut yer face, Pete! You’re too goldarned
mouthy!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who sez so?” Pete scowled at him and laid
a hand on the revolver he carried in a holster
under his left arm. “Not you, you nosey hayseed—cut
yer cackle and let’s get goin’. I’m
fed up to the eyes with you and this stinkin’
swamp.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He beckoned to the others to follow and the
party filed aboard the amphibian.</p>
<p class="pnext">Weed splashed the dock with tobacco juice.
“Guess you must be one of them new aviators
the boss has hired,” he observed in his nasal
twang.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I guess you’re right,” said Bill. “Made
my first trip yesterday. Any orders?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nope—no orders. You’ve got a bunch of
gold aboard—be careful of it, that’s all. What’s
become of Thompson? He wasn’t so goldarned
stuckup as most of you fellers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Search me—I’m not wet nurse to every bum
pilot Martinengo hires,” Bill shot back carelessly.
“If that’s all, I reckon I’ll say bye-bye
and shove off. The big boss doesn’t pay me to
argue with slave drivers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Is that so?” snapped Weed. “Well, let me
tell you, young feller, that I’m boss of this camp.
What I say here <em class="italics">goes!</em>”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good!” said Bill. “That’s just what I’m
going to do now!”</p>
<p class="pnext">He cast off the lines that moored the plane to
the dock. Then he sprang aboard and slid the
cabin door shut and locked it amid a torrent of
abuse from the camp boss.</p>
<p class="pnext">Without a word to the grinning men seated
in the cabin, he went forward and into the pilot’s
cockpit shutting this door after him as well.
With a wink at Osceola he slipped into his seat
behind the wheel and after giving the plane’s
three engines a short test, he let in his clutch.</p>
<p class="pnext">The big ship, which had been slowly drifting
away from the dock and the irate Mr. Weed,
began to gather headway. Bill taxied her round
in a wide half circle until he got her head into
the light wind with a long stretch of open lagoon
ahead. A slight widening of the throttle sent
the big bus hurtling down the straight-away.
Then Bill jerked her onto the step and a moment
or two later she was in the air.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill climbed until the altimeter on the instrument
board marked four thousand feet. Then
he leveled off and after a slight bank to port,
headed the big amphibian due east. Flying conditions
were excellent. A light wind blew out
of the southeast, but the air was smooth, without
a ripple. A cloudless sky of light blue dipped
to a sharply defined horizon; and near the rim
of the inverted bowl the pale green of the Everglades
contrasted with the darker foliage of the
cypress swamps. Here and there and everywhere,
lakes, lagoons and wandering streams
sparkled and danced in the sun glare like uncut
brilliants on a bed of green velvet.</p>
<p class="pnext">With his free hand, Bill unhooked a headphone
set from the side of his seat and adjusted
it. At the same time he motioned Osceola to
don the set at the other end of the cord.</p>
<p class="pnext">“So far, so good,” he spoke into the transmitter
which hung on his chest. “I don’t think
we’ll have trouble with our passengers for a
while yet, anyway. They seem to have no suspicion
but what we are Martinengo’s pilots.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But you do expect trouble?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bound to have it. We are off the regular
course to Shell Island now. Those lads aft probably
won’t smell a rat until we get over the
Everglades. Then they’ll want to know the
reason why.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What can we do about it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Stall ’em off somehow. I’ll think of some
gag to tell them. When we get nearer Miami,
I can wire the chief of police to bring some of
his men and meet the plane at the airport.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola’s tone was not encouraging. “I
wonder,” he said.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Wonder what?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m afraid you’re too sanguine, Bill. I know
this type of bully and scoundrel we’re up against.
What is more—several of those men back there
in the cabin know me—I bear the marks of their
whips on my back.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Umm!” grunted Bill, his fingers drumming
a tattoo on the wheel. “They’ll have to smash
the cabin door to get out here. I shot the bolt
when I came forward.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But that door won’t hold them if they once
get going,” he argued. “They’ll probably bust
through—stick a gun to your head and force
you to fly them to the Island.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But they won’t shoot,” replied Bill with
conviction. ”They’ll know that that would
mean a crash and pretty certain death.“</p>
<p class="pnext">“How do you figure that? If they don’t
recognize me in this rig, they’ll think I can take
over from you and fly this ship—after your
lights have been put out. I tell you, Bill, we’re
up against it, good and plenty!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I reckon you’re right,” sighed Bill, and was
silent.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently he spoke again. “A captain should
stay with his ship to the last,” he murmured, as
if giving vent to his secret thoughts. “But there
are exceptions to every rule.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are you saying?” Osceola was puzzled.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill hesitated for a moment, then went on
with sudden energy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Open the locker under this seat. There are
three or four parachutes stowed away there. I
saw them when I first came aboard. Pull out
three of them—one for each of us. When you
and Sam have got into yours, I’ll put on mine.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How are you going to fly the plane and do
that, too?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Get yours on and I’ll show you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola brought forth two of the parachutes
and passed one over the seat to Sam. A motion
or two from Bill gave them an idea of how to
adjust the harness, and presently Osceola
brought out the one for Bill. That young gentleman
laid it on his wheel and began to issue
further instructions.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Place your feet on your rudder pedals, Osceola,
and keep her nose pointed just as she is.
That’s right. Now take hold of your wheel.
No—don’t clamp onto it that way. Hold it
lightly—that’s better. This wooden yoke to
which your wheel and mine are attached controls
the elevators, those horizontal planes on
either side of the rudder—Push your wheel
forward and with it the yoke—your plane flies
downward. Pull back your wheel and she flies
upward.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I didn’t expect to be given flight instruction
today—”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill laughed. “That isn’t the half of it, boy.
I’m telling you this much just so you can guide
the ship while I put on my parachute. But
here’s some more dope. These wheels are attached
by wire cables to the ailerons, those
hinged surfaces at the end of each wing. Their
function, as they say in the Air Service, is primarily
to impress a rolling movement to the
airplane; just as the elevators are to impress a
pitching movement. You see, in flying a plane,
one not only has to steer it and balance it for the
roll to either side like riding a bicycle,—the
plane has to be balanced for the pitch fore and
aft as well.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola nodded his understanding. “I get
you. Balance for the roll sideways by turning
this wheel in the opposite direction from which
she’s tipping.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Right-o!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To raise the nose, I pull back the wheel; to
lower it, I push it forward.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Go to the top of the class,” grinned his
friend. “You’re letter perfect, at least.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good enough. But those gauges on the
instrument board?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You can keep half an eye on the inclinometer
and fore-and-aft level if you want to;
but I always think it is better to learn by the
feel of the plane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll do my best,” asserted Osceola, intent
now on what was before him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good fella! Some day I’ll start giving you
real flight instruction. This is just a makeshift.
Oh, I forgot—this plane is a bit noseheavy.
Don’t let it worry you. Keep pulling back on
your wheel as she dips. All ready to take over?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“—Ready’s brother!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay. She’s yours. Fly her!”</p>
<p class="pnext">With an eye on his assistant, Bill gave up the
controls and busied himself with the parachute.
That job completed he made sure the release
cord was in working order and spoke to Osceola.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re doing fine. I’ll take her back now.
There’s something else I want to say. We’ll be
over the Everglades in a few minutes. And
those guys in the cabin will be getting nervous.
When the trouble comes, it will come fast. If
the ship gets out of control—don’t stay with it—jump!
And don’t forget to pull the release
cord on your parachute. Pass the word to Sam
and tell him to stand up. And, by the way, if I
should wave a hand above my head, jump anyway—don’t
wait for me—get that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You bet.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola pulled a pencil and small pad from
the pocket of his jumper. He wrote a few lines
and passed the slip of paper to Sam.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just one thing more and then we’re set,”
added Bill into the transmitter on his chest.
“Have your gun handy—and don’t be afraid
to use it. Good luck, old skate.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good luck, Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Get rid of your phone set now. We won’t
need it for the present. The cord might get
tangled in things if there’s a rough-house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He stripped his own headgear and turned his
full attention to guiding the amphibian.</p>
<p class="pnext">They were past the Big Cypress now, and
far below lay the Everglades. This western
edge of the great lake was dotted with uncounted
islands, some large, some small, and all covered
with a luxuriant forest growth. High sawgrass
hid the water, save in numerous little channels
wandering in a network, sometimes coming
to a blank end, sometimes broadening into clear
spaces abloom with pond lilies. This flat, rather
monotonous landscape spread on and out as far
as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill had decided that it would be well to head
farther into the north, when he felt the vibration
of a sudden jar. His head snapped round
as the cabin door crashed open and two men
sprang into the cockpit. Both held revolvers
and behind them crowded the other passengers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Instinctively he pushed his wheel forward,
then pulled it sharply toward him. The plane
nosed over and with increased momentum from
the dip it shot upward at a precipitous angle.
The result so far as her passengers were concerned
was much as though they had been standing
on the broad back of a steady circus horse
who suddenly metamorphosed into an outlawed
bronco—and bucked! Losing their balance as
the amphibian nosed over, the gangsters were
hurled backwards by the second maneuver and
landed in a sprawling heap by the door, and
along the cabin aisle.</p>
<p class="pnext">A bullet crashed into the instrument board.
It had missed Bill’s head by the fraction of an
inch. And although he knew that the duration
of his life would probably be a matter of seconds,
he stuck to his post. Forward went his wheel
again, the plane leveled off and with a glance at
the calm-eyed Indian beside him, he held up his
right hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xiitwixt-wind-and-water">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id13">CHAPTER XII—’TWIXT WIND AND WATER</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Osceola stood up and gave Bill a questioning
glance which said plainer than words—“Further
directions, please?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill motioned toward the lower wing section
on Osceola’s side of the plane, mouthed the
word “jump,” and patted the pull ring on his
own parachute harness.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola scrambled out of the cockpit onto the
wing. For a moment he clung to an interplane
strut and beckoned Sam to follow. Sam hurried
after him, although from the expression on
the negro’s face, it was evident that he was terrified.
Bill saw him crawl across the wing to the
rear edge where Osceola stood. Then as the
old man got to his feet, still clinging frantically
to the strut, the Seminole, facing forward, gave
a tug on his pull ring. The seat pack parachute
bellied out behind him and he disappeared from
sight.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the same instant, Bill felt a heavy hand on
his shoulder, and the blue-black muzzle of an
automatic was pushed into his face. Instinctively
he leaned forward to dodge the gun. The
wheel went with him, and bucking like a
frightened cow pony, the big plane shot into a
nose dive.</p>
<p class="pnext">This maneuver sent Bill’s antagonist sprawling
onto the wooden yoke to which both wheels
were attached, forcing it forward as far as it
would go. The gangster’s head smashed into
the instrument board and he lay inert. Himself
thrown forward by the amphibian’s dive, Bill
caught at the seat to save his own head. The
man’s unconscious body prevented any manipulation
of elevators or ailerons. The plane was
beyond his control, and racing earthward with
wide open throttle at a hair-raising rate of speed.
He must save himself if he could: within a
second or so the big aircraft would be but a
twisted mass of burning wood and metal flaming
in the swamp below. Luckily, the pilot’s cockpit
had no roof. Bill dragged himself on to the
back of his seat, which, now due to the plane’s
almost vertical position, had become a small,
horizontal platform. With a hand on the pull
ring of his parachute pack, he dived head first
over the cockpit’s cowl into the open ether.</p>
<p class="pnext">The approved types of parachutes are the
manually operated free type. A “free” type
parachute is one that is complete in one unit,
strapped to the person of an aviator by a suitable
harness, and one that has no attachments whatever
to the aircraft. A “manually operated”
parachute is one that will unpack automatically
when the wearer gives a slight pull on the ring
located in a readily accessible place on the harness.
The aviator can open his parachute just
when clear of the disabled airplane or he can
make a long free drop away from burning
wreckage or a pursuing enemy plane before he
pulls the ring.</p>
<p class="pnext">And this is why Bill did not pull the ring on
his manually operated, free parachute before
diving out of the amphibian. Should the body
or air bag of the chute come in contact with the
plane, he would naturally crash with it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill was not a trained parachute jumper.
That part of an aviator’s training is usually
confined to those who specialize in lighter-than-air
craft, and Bill was a heavier-than-air pilot.
The sensation of diving into the air, several
thousand feet above the earth was anything but
a pleasant one. But his nerves were steady. He
kept his head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“One,” he said to himself, as he sprang outwards
and down...</p>
<p class="pnext">“Two—” He felt his body twisting in his
fall. He knew he was catapulting earthward at
a falling speed of nearly 400 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Three!” He jerked on the pull ring.
Would the chute open? Would it be capable of
withstanding the shock incurred by the weight
of his body falling at this terrific rate of speed?
(He knew that the average time required for
an air chute to open and assume normal descent
is approximately one and three-fifths seconds
after the rip cord has been pulled). But that
mere second and a fraction seemed interminable.
He was falling ... falling...</p>
<p class="pnext">There came a sudden jerk that wrenched
every muscle in his tense body. His projectile-like
speed decreased with uncomfortable suddenness,
and he was swung round and upward to
find himself sitting in what amounted to a swing,
with webbing representing the ropes on either
side of his aching body. Looking up, he saw
that slightly above his head and within reach,
the webbing divided into two, and that the
shrouds or small cords leading to the outer edge
of the parachute were here attached to the harness
he wore, in four places. He was swaying
wildly. In an effort to prevent that, he pulled
the ropes, first on one side, then on the other.</p>
<p class="pnext">All this had happened in an inconceivably
short space of time. Three, possibly four seconds
had elapsed since Bill had sprung out of the
doomed amphibian. For the moment, his mind
had been intent upon his own particular troubles,
but now that he swung safely in his harness,
memory came back. He turned his eyes earthward.</p>
<p class="pnext">Almost directly below him, a column of black
smoke smudged the clear green of the swamp
grass. At the very base of the dark cloud, red
tongues of flame shot skyward. Bill turned his
gaze elsewhere. His former passengers were
undoubtedly as cold-blooded, black-hearted a
band of villains as had ever lived; still, they
were, or had been human beings. And Bill had
no desire to watch their cremation and the demolition
of a splendid plane.</p>
<p class="pnext">His eyes swept the horizon. Yes, over there
perhaps a mile to westward two parachutes, one
far below the other, were floating down toward
earth. Even as he looked, the farther one disappeared
behind tall trees on an island.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Confound it all! I clean forgot to tell those
two innocents anything about landing. Hope
they don’t get into trouble—it’s my fault if
they do!”</p>
<p class="pnext">He knew that the average rate of descent is
sixteen feet per second, and unless one knows
how, a broken leg or worse may be the outcome
of an inexperienced landing. But their luck
had held so far, apparently. Osceola and Sam
were both sinewy, well-muscled fellows—they
would probably come out all right. For all their
sakes, he hoped so. A disabled companion in the
middle of the Everglades, with no means of
transport other than one’s two legs, would prove
a problem that Bill did not care to contemplate.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then he saw Sam disappear with his parachute
in the high sawgrass. He was coming
close to earth himself. In a very few minutes,
he would land, and his gaze switched to the
terrain directly below.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola had landed on the firm ground of a
large island. Sam had not been so lucky, for
Bill knew that the Seminole name for the Everglades
is Grassy-Water, and that sawgrass does
not grow on dry land. He himself was floating
over the island, but he soon saw that the wind-drift
would carry him, too, into the grass unless
he could prevent it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Up went his hands, and getting a good grip
on the parachute shrouds, he pulled down hard
on the ropes to windward. The chute immediately
bellied in and sideslipped into the wind.
He dared not overdo the business, and presently
righted the chute by the simple expedient of
releasing the shrouds. In a fall of one hundred
feet, Bill figured he had sideslipped ten. He
had seen men spin their parachutes in order to
swing aside from some building or other obstacle.
He knew that the trick is done by pulling
down on one side, then releasing the pressure
with a sort of flipping motion. He
attempted it, without success; after a few
failures gave it up in favor of the easier sideslips.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was almost down now, and delighted to
see that due to his system of sideslipping, the
parachute would land him on the island.</p>
<p class="pnext">Down he came, swaying slightly, onto a patch
of soft green turf, dotted with wildflowers.
Knowing that the body should relax in landing,
he made no effort to stand erect, and endeavored
to absorb the shock of his fall to some extent by
rolling over in the direction that he was drifting.
Consequently, his tumble did him no harm; the
parachute rolled into a large cypress at the edge
of the open space and came to a stop. The jump
was over.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill got out of his harness, repacked it, and
throwing the bundle over his shoulder, set off
to find his two companions. Over to the west, a
mile or more from the island, the burning amphibian
sent its tower of thick black smoke
mushrooming skyward.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill walked for half a mile along the edge of
the sawgrass, and then he saw two familiar
figures appear from out a clump of trees.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Osceola! Sam!” he called, and ran forward
to meet them.</p>
<p class="pnext">His friends waved to him, but did not quicken
their pace. The old negro seemed to be leaning
heavily on Osceola’s arm, and as he drew nearer,
Bill saw that their clothes were dripping wet.</p>
<p class="pnext">The young Seminole grinned as he came up.
“You look as fresh as a daisy!” His tone was
cheerful, though it held a hint of weariness. “I
certainly hated to leave you up yonder in the
plane with that bunch of cutthroats. Sam did
too. We’ve been talking about it. Until I saw
your parachute open up, I was darned worried,
I can tell you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” beamed Bill, grasping their hands,
“it sure is good to see you both again, I’m okay,
but I take it you made bad landings. My fault,
too,—I should have explained more about it before
you jumped.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dat’s all right, Marse Bill,” piped up Sam.
“It’s me what brung de trouble. Marse Osceola,
he sure am a born parachuter! He done landed
fine on dis island—but dis old nigger crabbed
everything. Come down in de grass out yonder.
Dem sharp-tooth edges sure cut me pretty bad.
And I ain’t no hand at dis jumpin’ business nohow.
Like to drownded myself if Marse
Osceola hadn’t come in an’ drug me out. Got
all tangled up in de grass and dem ropes, wif de
big umbrella down on top of me, tryin’ t’ smudder
me to death. I sure is obliged to you gentlemen
for gettin’ me away from de workin’s—but
I’d rather stay put there all my born days
than go through all dat again. Not <em class="italics">me</em>, suh!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man sat down suddenly, and began
to shake all over.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Take it easy, Sam,” cautioned Bill. “Just
don’t think about it for a while. Everything
will come out all right.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope so, Marse Bill.” Sam’s tone, though
gloomy, was much less excited. “Dis heah airplane
stuff an’ parachutin’ may be all right fo’
white folks—but if I must do a loop-de-loop,
let mine be roun’ some chicken coop.” He
grinned appreciatively at his own joke. “Thank
goodness I’m down here where I’s gwine to stay.
I ain’t gwine to be a-oozin’ round de sky no mo’—Dis
heah nigger ain’t got too proud to walk.
Nobody ain’t gwine to ketch Sam a-flirtin’ wif
de sun no mo’. Unh—unh! Not <em class="italics">me!</em>”</p>
<p class="pnext">Both lads burst out laughing. “You’ve got
more nerve than the rest of us put together,
Sam,” declared Osceola.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You sure have!” Bill knelt at his side.
“Osceola is a warrior and a gentleman, but he
can’t bandage for a tinker’s hoop. Let me fix
those things. And how about this ankle—you
were limping, uncle?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It ain’t no sprain, suh. I kin walk on dat
foot—but she sure do hurt po’werful bad.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ve wrenched and strained it.” Bill’s
deft fingers were lightly pressing the old man’s
ankle. “We’ll bind it up tighter and keep you
off your feet for a couple of days, and you’ll be
able to do your hundred yards in ten flat!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Help him off with his wet clothes, Bill,
while I get rid of mine,” Osceola suggested.
“They’ll soon be dry in this sun.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s a good idea. While you two are
drying, I think the best we can do is to have a
meeting of the Ways and Means Committee.
We’re still an awful longways from anywhere.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam nodded his head vigorously. “You done
said a mouf-ful, suh. I hope I ain’ no gloom—but
we sure is in a bad fix. Dese heah Glades is
a mighty bad place to git stranded in widout a
boat. I don’t know but what dem fellers what
come down in de airplane wasn’t de lucky ones!”</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id14">CHAPTER XIII—OSCEOLA FINDS A WAY</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The young Seminole spread his dripping uniform on
the grass to dry and dropped to his full length on
the sward near Sam and Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’ve got to build a boat of some kind,”
he declared. “Otherwise there’ll be no leaving
this island. Let’s see what we can scare up between
us in the way of tools.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I got a big clasp knife what belonged to one
of dem pilots,” volunteered Sam.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And I’ve got the same chap’s automatic, and
a knife I picked up in the kitchen,” added Osceola.
“How about you, Bill?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Another automatic and a dry box of matches
are the limit of my contributions,” returned
that young man. “Not much of an assortment,
eh? If we could get out to the plane we might
be able to find an axe or something.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola shook his head. “I doubt it. The
smoke has almost disappeared, which means that
the amphibian or what’s left of her is sinking
in the swamp. Anyway, without something to
float on we can’t leave this island. The rock
floor of the Everglades basin lies from six to
twelve feet down in the muck and water.
Even with a boat, traveling is no joke. That
grass grows ten feet high in some places. You’ve
seen what its saw-tooth edges have done to Sam.
That’s nasty stuff to fool with—take it from
me!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stared gloomily over the prairie-like
monotony of the Glades. Smoke from the wreck
had now entirely disappeared. He shuddered
as his mind dwelt for an instant on the horrible
fate of its gangster-passengers. Then his eye
caught the deeper green of trees in the far distance.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There seem to be a lot of islands in this
big swamp,” he said. “Many of them inhabited,
Osceola?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not in this part of the Glades, Bill. My
people are practically the sole inhabitants of
this part of the world. And they live on islands,
of course. But a long, long way from here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you any plan?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes—I think so.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, spring it then, old top. You’re in
command from now on. I know as little about
this kind of thing as—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As I do about flying,” supplemented Osceola
with a grin.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Rather less, if you ask me. Let’s hear what
you propose, Chief.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The young Seminole did not reply at once.
His bronzed forehead was corrugated in a
frown. For several minutes he seemed lost in
thought.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There are just three things we’ve got to
have,” he said suddenly. “And we’ve got to
have them right away.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Water, food and a boat,” Bill suggested.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Right. If we’re forced to, we can drink
Glades water, but it’s dangerous, and would
probably make us ill. There ought to be a spring
or two on this island; I reckon you’re elected to
the job of locating fresh drinking water, Bill,
and bringing it into camp.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Food, next,” mused Osceola. “Sam—do
you think you can hobble round well enough to
attend to the commissariat?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I sure can,” grinned the old darkey. “If I
ain’t mistook, I done catch a glimpse of half a
dozen blue heron back yonder. Dey ain’t
chicken, a-course, but dey sure is a mighty fine
eatin’. Loan me dat shooter of yourn, Marse
Bill, and dis heah nigger will provide dinner.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill passed over his revolver. “I’ll trade you
for your knife, Sam, while you get into your
clothes. I’ve got to have something to make a
water container—that is, when I find the
water.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He pulled his parachute toward him and
commenced to untie the pack.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Reckon I’ll mosey along,” announced Osceola.
“I’ve got to manufacture a boat of some
sort.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You ain’t a-gwine to get far with dat knife
o’ yourn in makin’ a dugout, Marse,” broke in
Sam.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But that’s not my idea,” the Seminole said
quietly, but without giving any further information
about his plans. “Bill, when you get
through totin’ water, look me up, will you? I’m
going along there to the east. You’ll find me
near the shore—and I’ll probably need your
help.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay,” sang out Bill, pulling his parachute
from the pack. “I’ll join you as soon as I can.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola departed, and presently old Sam,
after watching Bill for a moment, hobbled off
in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill spread out the parachute on the ground
and proceeded to cut off a large circular piece of
the fabric. Next he cut a piece from the shroud,
and painstakingly unravelled strands from the
rope. That completed, he cut off three green
branches from a nearby sapling—trimmed
them, and cut two to a length of approximately
eighteen inches and the third somewhat shorter.
After notching their ends, he laid the two longer
ones side by side and bound the ends together
with strands from the parachute rope. The
next operation was to bend them outward and
apart at the center and to slip the shorter notched
stick crosswise between them. When its ends
were bound to the other poles to keep it firm and
in place, he found himself possessed of an oval
wooden frame.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill now laid this aside and picked up the
piece of fabric he had cut. The outer edge of
this he lapped over his oval frame. Then with
his knife blade he punched eyelets through the
double lap of cloth, and by passing strands of the
rope through them, shortly managed to bind the
edges of the fabric to his frame. The result was
an open-mouthed bag-like container or bucket,
which, inasmuch as the fabric was waterproof,
would carry any liquid he placed in it.</p>
<p class="pnext">His task was now completed, so sticking
the open knife in a log where Sam on his return
would be sure to see it, he set off with his
collapsible pail to find drinking water.</p>
<p class="pnext">The island, which Bill found to be about two
miles long by half a mile wide, was covered with
a heavy growth of cypress. Some of these trees
were very old. He came across many whose
trunks and branches were smooth and white,
crowned with feathery foliage of a dazzling
golden green. These beautiful trees usually
grow amid clumps of dark evergreens such as
bay, magnolia, and myrtle, and the effect was
very striking. The small jungle was tropical in
nature: stately palmettos raised their plumed
heads toward the brilliant blue sky, and the
forest glades were painted bright with flowers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill followed one of the green aisles which
wandered through the trees toward the middle
of the island. Twice he heard the dull intonation
of a distant revolver shot and wondered
what luck Sam was having with his substitute
for chicken. The wood was alive with birds.
All seemed quite tame, and paid no attention to
this unusual visitor to their sylvan haunts.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently he found the marshy ground that
he was looking for; and in a little hollow nearby,
a bubbling spring of cold, sweet water. Bill refreshed
himself with a long drink of the life-giving
liquid. Then he filled his fabric pail
and went back to the spot where the conference
had been held.</p>
<p class="pnext">Here he found Sam, who already had a fire
going and was plucking the feathers from a big,
long-legged bird. On the turf beside him lay
another. Bill recognized the great blue heron,
familiarly known to the natives of Florida as
“the Major.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I didn’t know that those things were good
eating,” he observed as he hung the waterbucket
on a branch in the shade. “Dad shot a couple
last year which he has had stuffed. They were
pretty skinny—bags of bones, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dere warn’t no moon, I reckin,” Sam said,
busy with his plucking.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Moon—what do you mean?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“De moon am full now.” Sam’s grin disclosed
two perfect rows of snow white teeth.
“Dat’s de reason, Marse Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, quit your kidding, Sam!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I ain’t a-kiddin’ you, suh. Feel dis heah
Major.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill lifted the bird from the old darkey’s
knees. It was plump and heavy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” he exclaimed.
“That’s sure a surprise to me, Sam. But I still
can’t see what the moon’s got to do with its
being fat.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam’s laugh awoke the forest echoes. Evidently
he was enjoying the joke. He reached
for the heron and went on denuding it of
feathers.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Reckin eddication ain’t everything,” he
chuckled. “Dis nigger never had no schoolin’,
but he know dat de Major only eats when de
moon am full. Twelve times de year he am fat
an’ twelve times de year he am lean.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I’ve got to hand it to you, all right,”
laughed Bill. “Now I’m going to shove off and
give Osceola a hand. So long!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“So long, suh. When yo’all hears me whistle—come
to dinner.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill found Osceola near the marsh half a mile
away. Close by stood a giant cypress whose
straight stemmed trunk must have measured at
least twelve feet where the tall shaft sprang
from the buttressed base of the tree, and rose
perhaps a hundred and fifty feet in the air,
topped by a wide-spreading head of great limbs
and branchlets. At the Indian’s feet lay one
of these limbs and a glance at its five foot butt
showed Bill that the big branch was hollow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hello!” greeted Osceola. “Find your
spring?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You bet-cha,” returned his friend. “There’s
a bucket of fresh water in camp now.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s fine. We’re in luck all way round
the circle.” He pointed to the hollow limb.
“There’s our dugout. Nature is a great help
when you lack tools. She’s half built already.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How did you happen to find it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, you see, I knew exactly what I was
looking for, and headed toward the biggest cypress
in sight. An immense tree like that one
is very, very old. It’s been here for a thousand
to two thousand years, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whew!” Bill stared up at the towering
giant with an interest that was almost reverence.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, it was an old tree when Ponce de Leon
was looking for his fountain of youth in these
Glades,” continued the Seminole. “But for
hundreds of years it has been dying, and these
old cypresses die backward, or downward, during
a period of one to four centuries. The heart
decays and the last stage is generally a hollow
cylinder. A hurricane from the Gulf brought
down this limb, of course.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But surely you don’t expect to fashion a
canoe out of that with a knife!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What we can’t cut, we can burn. And after
dinner, we’ll have Sam’s help and his knife.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Gosh—it looks to me as if it will take a
year!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Two days at the most,” countered the Indian.
“The wood, though very strong, is not
heavy, except when it’s green; and a dead branch
like this is easy to work on. Break off some of
the smaller branches and get a fire going in that
hole I’ve just finished digging under the limb—see
it?—halfway down its length, there.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill went to work, collecting dry wood and
twigs for the fire.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Aren’t you afraid we’ll burn up the whole
thing?” he asked, after a moment or two.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, no, that’s easily prevented,” Osceola
replied. He had whittled a flat spade wherewith
to dig the fire hole and now he began to
pack moist earth round the trunk on the side of
the hold nearest to the butt of the log. “Of
course she’ll burn a bit inside,” he went on, “but
I’ve plugged the butt with moss and dirt.
Mighty little air can get in through that end.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For the next hour or so the lads were kept
busy; the one adding to the pile of burning brush
heaped completely around the limb, the other
preventing the spread of the fire toward the
butt of the log. By the time Sam’s shrill
whistle announced dinner, the hollow shell had
been burned clear of its upper end and they were
able to roll the twenty-foot log clear of the fire.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was delicious fare Sam had waiting for the
lads by the camp fire. True, it consisted of but
one dish, roast heron, washed down with spring
water. But all three diners voted it a success,
for a keen hunger is the best of all appetizers,
and anyone who has eaten “the Major” when
roasted, knows that this great bird is worthy of
any feast.</p>
<p class="pnext">The meal over, the three adventurers repaired
to the hollow cypress log. Bill and Osceola
got to work cutting horizontal grooves
along the trunk on lines that marked the top of
the gunwales. Their progress was slow, but the
dying wood was not over-hard and they made
fair headway, despite the inadequacy of their
tools.</p>
<p class="pnext">Stones of any kind were a rarity on the island,
and it took Sam all of two hours to find one that
would be suitable for an ax-head. This he bound
to a wooden shaft with strips of cloth cut from
Bill’s jumper. When he finished the job to his
liking, the ax or hammer resembled those Indian
curios one sees in the museums of our large
cities.</p>
<p class="pnext">Toward sundown the mosquitoes which had
been pestering them all day, seemed to take on
a new lease of life. Clouds of the vicious, blood-thirsty
insects swarmed about the toilers, at last
making further work impossible. By a vote of
mutual consent they left the half-completed
dugout to the tender mercies of the stinging
pests, and hastened back to the camp fire.</p>
<p class="pnext">While Sam removed the second heron from
the hanging bucket and commenced its preparation
over the fire for the evening meal, Bill
trudged over to the spring. Upon his return
with a brimming bucket, he found that Osceola
had built a line of smudge-fires in a circle around
the fire, and that once within the ring, there
were no mosquitoes.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Bill suggested that a series of small
fires would have been easier to build than a solid
circle of flame, the Indian had smiled good-humoredly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Maybe so. But then, you know, snakes like
warmth and seek it. We’ve got to sleep on the
ground tonight, and there are several species in
this neck of the woods, that I’m not keen to have
for bedfellows. They won’t cross fire or hot
embers, though—‘Quod erat demonstrandum,’
as the geometry books have it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My error,” laughed Bill. “After this, I
shall refrain from criticizing my elders and
betters.”</p>
<p class="pnext">When the moon rose, Sam left them, while
the lads lay back on their beds of evergreens and
conversed. Several times they heard the report
of his gun, but when the hunter returned, carrying
three heron and a brace of duck he found
them deep in the slumber of exhaustion.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xivin-the-dugout">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id15">CHAPTER XIV—IN THE DUGOUT</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Old Sam was up with the sun, but it was not
until the big gourd he had found the night before
was steaming with a luxurious duck stew
that he awoke the tired lads.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How in the world did you concoct this stew,
Sam?” Bill waved his wooden spoon—handmade
by the old darkey—toward the savory-smelling
gourd, which was their common pot.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But how come, Marse Bill?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“This stew is boiled isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dat’s right, suh, it am.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, what I want to know is how you were
able to make a stew over the fire without burning
the gourd.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dat stew was made in the gourd, jes’ as you
say,” he chuckled. “But de gourd warn’t over
the fire, Marse Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quit your kidding, Sam—and tell me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I done hung the gourd on a low branch
yonder, suh, after I put in the meat an’ water.
Nex’ I heated two stones over the fire and when
dey was real hot, I dropped dem in the stew.
Soon as dey got cool, I put in two mo’ hot
stones—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And that,” broke in Osceola, “is the oldest
method of heating water known to man!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill shook his head. “Well, when we left the
workings, I thought I was supposed to run this
show,” he said gravely. “Guess I was a bit
high-hat about it, too. And now, everywhere
I turn, you two teach me something new. I’ve
certainly learned my lesson.—Let’s get to work—I
can use brawn if not brain!”</p>
<p class="pnext">There followed a day of strenuous labor for
all of them. The top of the log above the long
grooves they had cut the afternoon before, was
beaten in with the stone hammer. When it was
at last removed, Bill took his wooden adze that
he had hardened in the fire, and began to scrape
the rotten wood from the inner shell of the
canoe. Meanwhile Osceola and Sam whittled
out two blocks of soft wood wherewith to plug
the ends of the open log. These were wedged
into place and moss hammered into the seams.
Then, thwarts were fitted and the canoe sunk in
shallow water to give the seams at bow and stern
a chance to swell. After supper, all three busied
themselves making paddles.</p>
<p class="pnext">Next day they were up before dawn and
hauled out their canoe. After a night’s submersion,
she appeared to be absolutely watertight.
At an early hour, they got aboard, with
the remains of their slender store of provisions,
and pushed out through the saw grass.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill took his place amidships, with Sam in the
bow, and the young Seminole wielded a paddle
in the stern. “I know that you’re skipper of this
cruise, Osceola,” he flung the words over his
shoulder, “but I think we ought to go out to
the wreck of the plane before we leave this
locality for keeps. What do you say?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s okay with me. I don’t expect we’ll find
much. The water is pretty deep in this part of
the Glades.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do you think you can find the spot? It’s
more than I could do.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes, easily enough. I was raised in these
swamps, remember. I know exactly where the
amphibian nosed in.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He swung the dugout to the left, and a few
minutes later they came out of the high saw
grass on to one of the myriad water leads that
crisscross the Everglades in every direction.
The grass near the Island had not been particularly
dense; but now they noticed that the
growth which lined the lane of open water was
a ten-foot jungle of stiff, saw-toothed stems.
Even the lead they were following was not free
from obstruction, for huge patches of water
lilies choked the way, and the power needed to
force the canoe through the tangled masses of
blooms came only by back-breaking effort.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bill, I think we’ll have to pass up the
wreck,” declared Osceola from the stern of
their little craft. “It would take us all day to
push our way through the grass and we’d probably
get some bad cuts into the bargain. It isn’t
worth it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I thought we might be able to salvage something,”
said Bill, resting his paddle on the side
of the dugout.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No chance of that, anyway. The chances
are that nothing but the tailplane is above water
after her nosedive. These swamps are dangerous
to wade about in, even if there is a high
bottom over there, which I doubt.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“He means de ’gators and snakes,” Sam explained
fearfully. “We alls been lucky so far,
but let me tell you, Marse Bill, dese Glades is
sure plumb full o’ vipers. Dis nigger ain’t
gwine to do no mo’ wadin’ unless he has to.
Unh-unh! Not <em class="italics">me!</em>”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill grinned. “I retire under force of argument,”
he said with mock resignation. “Let’s
be on our way again. I think I can see clear
water ahead.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For the next half hour they slaved through
the lilies, and in the stretch of open water finally
reached, Bill spoke again.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know you’re making for the southeast,
Osceola. And I suppose you’ve got a plan. But
I should have thought you’d point north. Isn’t
there an automobile causeway that crosses the
Everglades somewhere up there?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola nodded. “There is, Bill, but I am
going to make for the home of my people. I
figure that we can get down there in three or
four days, if our luck holds. It would take us
much longer to reach the causeway.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good enough! Swell plan, I should say.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But that’s only half the plan, Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s the other half?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll tell you when I’ve talked with my
people. I’m not trying to be cagy, but I’ll need
their consent to put it over—and I don’t want to
get up false hopes, you know. You don’t mind,
if I keep it to myself till I’m more certain?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course not. I’ve been doing a little
thinking on my own. And maybe I can spring
mine when you come across with yours. If these
all-fired pond lilies would only—”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill never finished that sentence. There was
a stirring among the lilypads just aft of Bill’s
paddle. He caught a fleeting glimpse of what
he took to be a gnarled tree trunk among the
blooms overside. Then the stern of the dugout
rose in the air, toppled over, and clutching wildly
at the gunwale, he catapulted into the lilies.</p>
<p class="pnext">“‘Gator!” yelled a voice which he took to be
Sam’s, and the water closed over his head.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill landed on the small of his back, but just
as soon as he was able to get his balance under
water, he struck upwards with both hands and
feet. If a rising alligator had been the cause
of the canoe’s capsizing, he wasn’t staying in
that unlikely spot!—not any longer than needful.</p>
<p class="pnext">But instead of shooting to the surface, as he
naturally expected, Bill found himself held fast
in an interminable network of stems and roots.
The horrible sensation of strangling sent all
thought of ’gators, poisonous snakes out of his
head. Air—he must have air. Nothing else
mattered now. He tore at the tangled stems
with the vicious energy of a madman.</p>
<p class="pnext">At last, his lungs bursting, his head popped
up through the pads. As he shook the water
from his eyes, Sam’s black pate appeared above
the surface.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whar de ’gator?” he spluttered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Search me,” gasped Bill. “I didn’t even
see him.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The dugout floated bottom upwards a few
yards away. From beyond it came Osceola’s
voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hey, you two! This is no swimming pool.
Quit swapping yarns and give me a hand with
this canoe!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You go, Marse Bill,” begged Sam. “I’se
afraid dese here chaps will sink.” With an
effort he raised his right hand above the water,
and Bill saw that it grasped a duck. “I done
tied dese here birds all together fore we shoved
off,” explained the darkey. “Dey’s de first thing
I grabbed when dat ol’ ’gator come up underneath
de boat and turn us over. Dey like to
drownded me down in de weeds, an’ it ain’t
likely I’se gwine to turn ’em loose now to fix no
dugout. Unh-unh! Not <em class="italics">me!</em>”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill, with an amused grunt, started swimming for the
canoe in the middle of this narrative.
But by the time he reached it, Osceola
had righted it, and worked his way aboard by
pulling himself up the rounded stern. When
waist-high to the counter, he seemed to spring
forward on his hands, spreading his legs at the
same time so as to straddle both bulwarks. A
second later he was sitting on the low thwart,
holding out a helping hand to Bill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Gee, you’re an ace in the water, all right,”
gasped Bill, once he was aboard. “Some day
you’ve got to teach me that trick, Osceola.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Indian chuckled. “It takes little more
than muscle, Bill, and a certain nicety of balance.
You’ve got plenty of the first requirement,
and the other is only a matter of practice.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Look, here comes the commissary—he’ll
take a bit of hoisting!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola leaned overside and took the string
of birds from Sam. “How you managed to
hang on to these in the upset is beyond me,” he
said, depositing them in the bottom of the canoe.</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam was helped aboard.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You can’t keep dis nigger from his dinner,”
he grinned. “Dat is, no ’gator can’t. Did
you see him, Marse Osceola? He was sure a
big ol’ feller.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“He sure was, Sam. Reckon he was as surprised
as we were when the bunch of us came
splashing in on top of him. I was glad to get
out of the water, though. It’s not my idea of a
happy death to form a meal for an alligator. It
didn’t seem to worry you much. The way you
and Bill were holding pleasant conversation out
yonder was a temptation to any ’gator or his
friends.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“So that’s why you asked for help in righting
the canoe?” Bill asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ve guessed it. I’ve got my paddle, and
while I collect the other two, I suggest that you
clean the guns, Bill. Lucky they were strapped
to us.” He ripped off the tail of his shirt and
passed it over. “That will soon dry in the sun,
and a gat that shoots is worth somebody else’s
shirt any day in the week.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“There’s one thing about traveling light,”
admitted Bill, “and especially when your canoe
turns over. If you haven’t anything to lose,
you can’t lose it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You is forgettin’ the grub, suh,” chimed in
Sam.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But you clung to that like a hero,” grinned
Bill. “When we get to wherever we’re getting,
I’ll pin a medal on you, Sam. Just now, I’m out
of pins.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know you is kiddin’ me,” returned the
darkey, showing his teeth in a wide smile.
“Some day mebbe I’ll hold you to dat promise,
Marse Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay, Sam. Pass over any hardware you
may be toting. I want to clean it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">That night, after, a weary day of paddling,
they camped on an island which embraced several
miles of dry land. Here Osceola shot a
small deer, which they found a welcome change
in diet, from the fish-tainted flesh of birds.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There are just two things queer about this
place,” remarked Bill as they rested beside the
fire after supper.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are they?” asked the young Seminole
chief.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In every picture I’ve ever seen of the Florida
swamps, they have snakes hanging in festoons
from the trees—great, big fellows. Yet, so far,
I haven’t seen a single one.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s because they don’t happen to roost
in trees. Not in this state. That is, except in
the artist’s imagination. There are plenty of
snakes, though—rattlers, moccasins and the like.
Never go into high grass on these islands, or you
are not likely to come out alive. What’s the
other queer thing?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stretched his arms above his head, and
lay back comfortably on the warm earth. “Last
night,” he yawned, “the mosquitoes nearly drove
me crazy. Today there were very few, and
tonight, I haven’t felt one. There’s been no
wind to speak of—they can’t have been blown
away.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola laughed. “These glades aren’t such
bad places to live in. They have some advantages.
Of course, it is a snake infested wilderness, but there
is such a dearth of stagnant water
that few breeding places are furnished for
insects. You won’t find mosquitoes except along
the borders. We are well into the interior of
the Everglades, now, that’s why they’ve disappeared.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Three cheers and a tiger,” Bill applauded
in a sleepy voice. “Good night, everybody—I’m
off to bye-bye.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The next three days were counterparts of the
first, except that the party met with not a single
mishap. Whenever possible they kept to the
waterleads, and Bill soon grew sick of the sight
of pond lilies. But at times it was necessary
to pole their way through the sawgrass. Often
the grass had to be cut away in front, and all
three suffered from wounds made by its sharp-toothed
edges.</p>
<p class="pnext">About five o’clock on the fourth day of their
journey, they came through half a mile of grass
on to an open lead, free for once from lilies.
This led toward a large island, little more than
a mile away.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, we’re here at last,” announced Osceola,
as they rested from their labors.</p>
<p class="pnext">“<em class="italics">Here</em> is right—but where?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Some of my people live on that island. We’ll
be—home—in half an hour.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You certainly are a wonder!” cried his
friend. “I never really thought you would be
able to locate them in this wilderness.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you asks me,” broke in Sam, “I says, let’s
go! I never did think we’d get dis far without
bein’ cotched back to those workin’s. But now,
oh boy! Deer meat is all right an’ so am bird
flesh. But I likes my vittles varied. Too much
of a good thing am nothin’ more than too much.
Let’s go—cause I’m hungry!”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xvseminoles">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id16">CHAPTER XV—SEMINOLES</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The three weary paddlers sent their dugout
skimming down the open waterway toward the
island. As they approached, Bill saw that
Osceola was steering for an encampment that
covered about an acre, in a clump of palmettoes
near the water. He soon noticed that the
dwellings were built of six upright poles, three
on a side, and had gabled roofs of palmetto
thatch. Later he was to learn that the floors
were made of earth, and the main articles of
furniture were large tables which nearly filled
the interior. On these tables the Indians ate and
slept. Usually there were chests that held their
clothing and tools and firearms. Barrels and
boxes for provisions and, in rare cases, a sewing
machine, completed the essentials. An old sheet
or blanket is generally hung at one side of the
dwelling to keep out the wind and rain.</p>
<p class="pnext">Soon the inhabitants of this colony began to
crowd to the waterside, waving friendly greetings.
A few of the men were dressed in store
clothes, but most of them seemed to have an
antipathy for trousers. The habits of the Seminole
are so amphibious, they are in and out of the
water all day long, so that they invariably prefer
bare legs. The majority were costumed in the
old Seminole manner, in knee-length tunics of
banded red and yellow, tied with a sash at the
waist. The heads of the braves were covered
with red bandanna turbans.</p>
<p class="pnext">The squaws were easily recognizable by their
long calico dresses of blue or brown, gaily
striped in red and yellow, and they all wore
long strings of small beads, usually turquoise
and crimson. Silver coins beaten into various
designs decorated their head-dresses, and were
worn as bracelets and necklets. The elder children
were dressed exactly like their parents.
The younger ones wore what nature had given
them and nothing more.</p>
<p class="pnext">The canoe drew closer to the bank. Osceola
stood up in his place and shouted some words in
a strange tongue. Immediately there came a
change in the demeanor of the waiting Seminoles.
The mild curiosity in the arrival of
strangers, turned to shouts of jubilation as they
recognized their Chief. The braves rushed into
the shallow water, and raised the dugout with
its occupants to their shoulders. Amid cries of
welcome the men carried their heavy burden up
the bank and into the center of the village.</p>
<p class="pnext">Here Osceola made them a short speech.
There was much handshaking, in which both
Bill and Sam participated. Meanwhile, the
women rushed off to a circular shed nearby
where the cooking for the camp was done.
There was a great clattering of pots and pans by
the fire, from which logs radiated like the
spokes of a wheel, and soon the appetizing odor
of food was wafted to the tired travelers’ nostrils.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My people understand and speak English
readily enough,” Osceola told his friends. “But
they like me to speak to them in the mother
tongue. I’ve informed them that you are my
friends, that we are weary and hungry and in
need of sleep. Come now, we can make ourselves
comfortable while the women prepare
us a meal.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ whatever it is they’s fixin’, it sure do
smell good—yes, mighty fine to <em class="italics">dis</em> heah chile!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam grinned at Bill happily as they followed
their host toward a dwelling somewhat larger
and apart from the rest.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Some of dem squaws sure is grand women,”
chortled Sam, hobbling along in high glee at
Bill’s side. “Dis is what I likes, Marse Bill—good
eatin’s plenty of it, and a fine, strong
woman to cook an’ work for you.” He waved
at a two hundred pounder, and when the squaw
waved back, he deliberately closed one rolling
black eye in a wink.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, you old rascal!” Bill broke into a
shout of laughter. “I thought you told me you
had a wife and family somewhere!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam shook his woolly pate in mock pathos.
“Done had, Marse Bill, done had. My ole
woman b’leeve I’m dead years ago. If she’s
alive she’s married, dat am certain. Liza were
a sure goodlooker an’ a fine cook—an’ dat kind
never am neglected—not for long anyhow.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Take my advice and stop flirting with the
Seminole squaws, just the same, or some brave
will bounce a tomahawk off that skull of yours.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam spread his palms upward in a gesture of
apology. “’Tain’t my fault, Marse Bill, really
it ain’t.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whose then?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s de wimmen, Marse Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How do you make that out?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sam chuckled and brought his head near
Bill’s.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’s always a-botherin’ the goodlookin’
men,” he whispered.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola, who had the ears of a cat, turned
and winked at the old darkey. “Well, that lets
you out, Sam,” he laughed. “Come inside my
house, and rest. Tomorrow or the next day,
there is work to be done. After that you can
come back here, Sam, and loaf for the rest of
your life. And if you still want a squaw to look
after you, I’ll see about it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola’s house was in reality no different
from the other shelters in the camp, except that
it was larger, and more solidly constructed.
They entered, and Osceola swung himself onto
the central table, and the other two followed
suit. A semi-circle of Seminole warriors
squatted on the ground a few yards distant
and talked together in low tones.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently two women came in, carrying a
large kettle that swung on a stick between them.
They placed this on the table, and from its open
mouth protruded a single large spoon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“When in Rome, you know—” smiled
Osceola. “Help yourselves—take some, Bill,
and pass it on. If you must have knife and
fork and plate, they can be produced, but when
I am with my people I like to conform to their
customs. Hope you don’t mind.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The community spoon for me, old top,” and
Bill reached for it. “Is this the national dish?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I reckon so. It’s a meat stew thickened with
vegetables and meal. You ought to find it
pretty good.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do,” sighed Bill, blowing on a piece of
hot meat. “This is the best grub I’ve tasted for
a month of Sundays.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ could you all please hurry up an’ pass
dat spoon,” Sam broke in eagerly. “My mouf
sure am waterin’ for dat stew and my stummick
he say ‘hasten, brother, hasten’!”</p>
<p class="pnext">All three enjoyed the feast immensely and it
is to be feared that as the stew grew cooler,
fingers were quite as often in use as the common
spoon. Although it was still broad daylight
when they found the bottom of the pot, they
turned in, on the table, and slept like logs, rolled
up in blankets, until morning.</p>
<p class="pnext">The early sun came streaming in through the
open front of Osceola’s house. It shone in
Bill’s face and woke him. He stretched,
yawned and sat up. The young chief and Sam
were going through the same motions at opposite
ends of the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Morning, men!” he saluted them, rubbing
the sleep from his eyes. “Am I still dreaming,
Osceola, or has your village grown during the
night? There seem to be three or four times as
many people around.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The chief swung off his table bed. “There
are probably five times as many,” he answered.
“The villages of my people are small, but there
are many of them. Last night, while we slept,
signal fires flashed the news of my return.
Come along, and let’s get a wash before breakfast.
Afterward, there will be a big pow-wow.
I am going to put my plan up to the warriors.
You can do likewise.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But I can’t speak Seminole,” Bill reminded
him as they started toward the shore.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t worry, this conference will be held
in English. You see,” he explained, “our
villages only run to a few families because an
island can support only a few people. Over
there, beyond those trees, you will find a clearing
where our crops are raised; corn, squashes,
sweet potatoes, sugar-cane and so on. As you
may have noticed, chickens and razor-back hogs
run about wild.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes, and in all the big cities of Florida,
too,” said Bill with a straight face. Then they
both roared with laughter at Sam’s perplexed
frown.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Humph! You tryin’ to joke dis nigger,”
the darkey rolled his eyes, “but dat’s over my
head, suh, over my head!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You think it is now, but you’ll see!” warned
Bill with a twinkling grin. Then he joined
Osceola in his morning ablutions.</p>
<p class="pnext">An hour after breakfast, the men of the tribe
gathered in the open space between the shore
and the village. They sat in a wide circle on
the ground, with their squaws and children in
the background. Bill and Sam, led by Osceola,
were escorted to places in the center of this
group. The young chief lighted a long pipe of
tobacco, took a puff of the pungent smoke and
passed it to his white friend. Bill choked over
the pipe, then handed it to Sam. From the old
negro it went the round of the braves.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the pipe was laid aside, a deep silence
fell over the gathering, broken only by the
raucous call of birds in the treetops, or the
sudden splash of a leaping fish. This lasted for
fully ten minutes, then Osceola arose and with
quiet dignity began to speak. This time he used
English, and in simple words, but with the art
of the born story-teller that seems inherent in
all tribes of North American Indians, he told
the tale of his disappearance from the village.</p>
<p class="pnext">First he spoke of his capture by the Martinengo
gang, and how he had been taken to
Shell Island. Then came his trip by plane with
other prisoners to the gold diggings in the
Cypress Swamp. In graphic language he told
of his slavedom and of the pitiless cruelty of
his taskmasters.</p>
<p class="pnext">Outwardly calm, the warriors of his tribe sat
listening with faces devoid of all expression.
Yet if one looked closely, one saw clenched fists
and tightened muscles, and could realize that
this stoic behavior was but a poise that was part
and parcel of their tribal training. Actually
these Seminoles resented keenly the insult which
had been placed upon their young chief. Sometime
in the future their deeds would prove their
loyalty—now, he must not be interrupted, he
had more to tell.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola then went on to describe the coming
of Bill, the feeling of the overseer, their subsequent
escape and the crash of the amphibian.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My white brother who sits beside me here,”
he concluded, “downed the man who struck me,
thereby risking not only death for his act, but
the terrible torture of the lash. He is an officer
in the White Father’s great navy, a flyer of airplanes,
a person of importance among his own
people; yet he did that for a Seminole he had
known less than a day. Without his knowledge
of flying, escape from the Great Cypress would
have been impossible: and again, when death at
the hands of those gangsters stared us in the
face aboard the flying ship, he arranged for the
safety of this black man and myself while he
stayed behind to battle with them. That is why
I take him by the hand now and thank him in
the name of the once-great Seminole nation!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How! how!” chanted the warriors, while
Osceola bent down and grasped Bill’s hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now,” he continued, his thrilling tones
chaining the eyes of his audience to him, “what
are we going to do? Are we going to sit quietly
on our islands, and let these devils incarnate continue
to enslave our brothers and other defenseless
people? Have we become women now that
the number of our braves is small? Have we
forgotten the deeds of our heroes in the past?
Are we content to stand aside, content to let
this scum from the big cities offer insult day by
day to our once proud nation? Answer me—are
we men—or something more pitiful than
the weakest of women?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We are men!!” shouted the braves, a
hundred hands beating the air while their voices
rang resonantly in the stillness. “Lead us,
Great Chief. We will follow!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good. Go to your homes now. Come
back here on the third day from this. Let every
man come armed for battle and let him come
with food that will last for a week. Go now my
brothers, warriors of the Great Seminole Nation—I
have spoken.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Without a word, the men got to their feet,
collected their wives and children, and launched
their dugout canoes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now let’s hear your plan of campaign,”
suggested Bill, as he and Osceola stood watching
the departing flotilla. “That was some
speech you made just now, even though you did
lay it on a bit thick about me. I’m keen to know
exactly what you intend to do, now that you’ve
got your little army in back of you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xvithe-advance">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id17">CHAPTER XVI—THE ADVANCE</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“I told those chaps of mine not to come
back here until the third day,” said Osceola,
“because they will need a couple of days at least
to prepare for an expedition of the kind I have
in mind.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I shouldn’t think it ought to take them that
long—what have they got to do?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, paint themselves for battle, for one
thing. Have a war dance or two, and a lot of
the same. You must remember that my people
are only semi-civilized. The only way that
anyone can control them is to let them go their
own way, when it comes to tribal customs, that
do no one any harm. Buck that sort of thing—and
you are out of luck—good and plenty!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Simply that if I tried to ‘convert’ them,
they’d have little use for me—dead or alive.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean they’d do away with you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Literally, yes.” Osceola laughed at the expression
on Bill’s face. “But don’t worry—I
understand them, and so long as I let them alone,
they’ll love me. Anyway, you and Sam and I
can do with a couple of days’ rest, you know,
before we start out for the Big Cypress.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I agree with you on that. Gee, this sun is
getting hotter than hot. How about going up
to your abode? I haven’t sprung my idea yet.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, that’s so, old man. Certainly, come
along—I want to hear what you’ve got to say.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Once in the dim shelter of the chief’s house,
the two sat cross-legged on the central table and
Bill opened the conversation.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where’s Sam?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola shook his head amusedly. “Gone off
to see how the squaws make that stew. We
don’t need him. Spill the good old beans, Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well—your plan is to take your fighting
men across the Glades and clean out the diggings,
isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s right. Of course the details must
still be arranged, but we have plenty of time to
work them up before we start. Have you any
suggestions to make?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why not tackle the island first?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, I thought of that. But it’s a bigger
and harder job than the workings. Over in the
cypress swamps we can come down on the
stockade at night and surprise them. Shell
Island is quite another proposition. There’s
only one entrance to the place,—the bay. And
the Martinengos keep it well guarded. The
rest of the coastline is one continuous palisade
of unscalable cliffs.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But that’s where you’re wrong!” cried Bill.
“There is a spot where the cliffs can be
climbed—<em class="italics">and, not even the Martinengos know
of it!</em>”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola looked his amazement. “How did
you get on to it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Through Sam. He was a house servant, he
tells me, for the bosses on Shell Island for
several years. Gradually he became a trusty.
They gave him the run of the island, and while
off duty one day he discovered this place in his
rambles. He says that there is a small, sandy
beach at the foot of the cliff, and that any active
man can climb up or down without a great deal
of trouble. He has done it himself, so he ought
to know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, that throws a little different light on
the picture. I’d certainly like to clean out that
nest of cutthroats—but it’s a big job. I hadn’t
contemplated doing anything like that. My
plan was to free those poor devils who are slaving
in the Big Cypress—but——”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why not do the thing up brown, while we’re
at it? Of course, I needn’t tell you my main
motive is to release my father. And incidentally
to be revenged on the brains of this outfit—the
Martinengos. By Jove, man, I’ve hardly
dared think about Dad—let alone mention
him—when I picture him in that filthy
dungeon——” Bill’s voice broke and he
clenched his fists on his knees.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Naturally, Bill, I understand that. And I
am with you every bit of the way. But I feel
that we must reason it out very carefully—we
dare not fail, either way.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But how can we? With Dad free and Shell
Island in our hands, we could clean up the other
place properly!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola shook his head thoughtfully. “It’s
a long, long hike from the island to the
gold workings—twice as far from there as
it is from here. Even if we are able to
capture the island, some of the men are sure
to slip through our hands, get away in one of
the planes, perhaps and by the time we travel
on to Big Cypress, that gang there will have
been warned, they’ll be ready and waiting for
us. The chances are, in that case, we’d be
cleaned out. A surprise attack is one thing,
Bill, but a pitched battle with trained gunsters—I’d
simply be throwing away the lives
of my men who trust me. No, I can’t see it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill slid off the table and stood facing his
friend. “But you are leaving Dad out of the
picture!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dad has influence in Washington. The
President is a personal friend of his. Our job
is to clean up the island. Then he will get the
U. S. government to step in—and they will
attend to the Big Cypress business themselves.
You see? I should have told you this in the
beginning, but I guess I was sort of hazy when
I got thinking about Dad.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Seminole clapped him on the shoulder.
“That,” he said heartily, “is a bird of another
color, Bill! And I was worried about my men.
Your plan is approved and accepted without
question! Now, let’s forget the whole business
until my Seminoles come back here. I don’t
think I’ve ever been quite so tired as I am at
this minute. Just remember that those workings
are not any health resort. I’m all in—and
I’m going to sleep until I’m called for
dinner.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And I’m going to do the same thing. Isn’t
that a hammock over there between those
palms? Me for it. You may find a wooden
table comfortable to retire on, but as Sam
says—‘Unh-unh! Not <em class="italics">me!</em>’ Your hospitality
is lavish—but after last night I ache from head
to foot. Does the mighty chief mind if his
humble servant retires to the hammock?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If I had a shoe I’d throw it,” laughed
Osceola. “For goodness’ sake, take the hammock,
and anything else you want. On your
way—I’m sound asleep!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Sunrise two days later saw a flotilla of Indian
dugouts drawn up on the shore of the Seminole’s
island. The squaws of the little community
had been up half the night cooking, and now the
warriors were busily consuming what would
probably constitute their last hot meal for some
time to come.</p>
<p class="pnext">There were about sixty braves all told. Gone
now were their brightly colored tunics and head-dresses.
The entire band had stripped to a loin-cloth,
and the face and body of each man was
painted in designs of his own fancy. All heads
were shaven clean except for the scalp lock,
which was decorated with a single feather of
the red heron. Each brave carried a rifle, knife
and tomahawk.</p>
<p class="pnext">After they had eaten their fill, Osceola lined
them up on the shore and spoke a few words
to them in their own language. Bill stood beside
him and viewed the little army with keen
interest. Never had he seen such a fearsome
group. They brought to mind pictures of the
frontier days in the old West. If these fellows
were really as fierce as they looked, he thought
it boded ill for the Martinengos and their gunmen.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Osceola had finished his harangue, the
band of warriors commenced to board their
canoes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where in the world is Sam?” Bill asked
the chief as they walked toward the handsome
dugout that was Osceola’s private property.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here I is, suh!”</p>
<p class="pnext">A painted savage broke from the embrace of
a squaw twice his size and girth, and came running
up to them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good Lord, Sam! Where are your clothes?”
The chief stared at him in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ise a Seminole brave, now!” proudly announced
the darkey. “Lil Eva, she done fix me
up last night!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Little Eva!” exploded Bill. “That squaw
must weigh two hundred and fifty!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yas, suh! Fine woman. We gwine to git
married when I come back from killin’ off dem
gangsters. She say dat I’m her fightin’ man
now—an’ I b’leeve I cert’nly do look like one.”
He admired his painted chest, grinning from
ear to ear.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill and Osceola looked at one another and
roared with laughter. “Well, it’s okay with me,
Sam,” declared the chief. “Hop aboard with
your armory. It’s time we were on our way.
Lucky there are some blankets in the canoe,”
he added as he shoved off and sprang in after
them, “you’ll probably need several before we
get through with this picnic.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The chief’s dugout, with Bill, Sam and
Osceola wielding the paddles, shot swiftly down
the waterway. The flotilla of canoes closed in
single file behind. At last the expedition was
under way.</p>
<p class="pnext">The journey south through the Everglades
seemed but a repetition of their former trip to
Bill. The same endless stretches of sawgrass,
intersected by lily-choked waterleads swept out
to a low horizon. Occasional islands covered
with a dense jungle of brilliant green provided
the only variation in the monotonous landscape.
The sun swam in cloudless skies, pouring down
a heat that burned Bill’s flesh and sapped his
vitality. The others, if they minded the terrific
discomfort, appeared to ignore it. But Bill was
thoroughly glad when at the beginning of the
third day, they left the Everglades behind and
paddled slowly down the broad bosom of a
winding bayou.</p>
<p class="pnext">That night the little army camped on the
shore near the mouth of this arm of the sea.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’ll rest up tomorrow and plan the details,”
said Osceola, as they sat by their campfire
that evening. “Shell Island lies out there—about
fifteen miles away. So far, so good. I,
for one, am going to turn in now.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Call me at noon,” grunted Bill. “This
may be my last sleep on earth—and it’s going to
be a good one.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xviithe-attack">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id18">CHAPTER XVII—THE ATTACK</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">For some hours earth and water had been
bathed in the semi-darkness of a misty night
when the Seminole canoes issued from the broad
mouth of the bayou. The stench of the mangrove
swamps behind them still hung heavy in
the lifeless air, and as they advanced, a thick
gray fog crept in from the sea. Soon the trailing
folds of vapor rolled in opaque clouds along
the water, and hovered, damp and billowing,
over the moving flotilla.</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola shouted an order in Seminole and a
moment later, the bow of a canoe nosed beside
the stern of the leading dugout.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Stop paddling!” he commanded, and his
two companions obeyed. “I told the men to
close up in single file,” he explained to Bill and
Sam. “It is easy to go astray in a fog like this.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You said a mouthful,” returned Bill. “And
the first thing you know we’ll be heading back
to the mainland. There’s not a compass in the
whole outfit.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t worry about that. I’ll see that we
get to Shell Island all right.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, you’ve got your hands full,” retorted
his friend. “How do you expect to guide us?
I can’t see three feet overside.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“By instinct—an extra sense, perhaps, you
would call it. No man of my race ever loses his
bump of direction.”</p>
<p class="pnext">From the fog behind them came the hoot of
a nightbird.</p>
<p class="pnext">“All set—let’s go!” Osceola dipped his
paddle. “No talking, please, from now on.
Voices carry a long way over the water, you
know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For the better part of the next three hours,
the long line of dugouts forged ahead through
the heavy blanket of sea fog. Once more, the
journey seemed endless to Bill. His nerves were
tingling with the thought of the night’s work
ahead. Would Osceola be able to guide them
to the island? The chief paddled steadily onward,
seemingly never at a loss as to the direction
his little craft should take.</p>
<p class="pnext">Gradually this confidence was imparted to
the white lad. They would succeed ... they
must. Yet these Seminoles were but untrained
aborigines at best. Would they be able to overcome
the white men, professionals, only too
well versed in all the exigencies of gang warfare?
To the Seminoles this expedition meant
merely a matter of revenge, an insult to wipe
out. To Bill it meant the life and liberty of his
father. They must succeed, he told himself
desperately, for the twentieth time—they
<em class="italics">would</em> succeed.</p>
<p class="pnext">The fog grew less dense. A few straggling
wisps of mist played round the line of canoes
and were gone. From out the murk came the
dull roar of surf breaking on a rocky shore.
Then suddenly the grayish white of cliffs
loomed up straight ahead.</p>
<p class="pnext">From Osceola’s throat came the raucous
screech of an owl. As one man the flotilla
stopped moving.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Shell Island,” the chief whispered. “The
path up the cliffs is yonder, to the left. You go
to the right, Bill. You know my plans, and I
know yours.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“O—and likewise, K.” Bill’s voice was husky
with excitement, though he strove to keep it
casual. “Good luck and good hunting, old
man.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good luck, Bill.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They clasped hands, and an instant later, the
canoe following drew alongside. Bill immediately
changed places with the Indian who
had been paddling in the stern. He placed his
rifle carefully on the bottom of the canoe and
grasping his paddle, swung the craft round to
the right. Three more canoes fell into line
behind him, and the four left the main flotilla
and headed off to the westward, keeping the
cliffs and the pounding surf off their port
quarter.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill’s canoes pushed swiftly ahead over the
long ground swell until three quarters of an
hour later, the narrow entrance to the bay was
in sight. Now their pace slackened, the dip of
their paddles in the quiet water became barely
perceptible, and hugging the deep shadow of
the cliff, the canoes glided into the bay like dark
water wraiths on a jet black background.</p>
<p class="pnext">The sky was overcast, the visibility poor, but
Bill could make out the night lights of Martinengo’s
yacht. Nearby floated a large amphibian,
evidently a sister ship of the one wrecked
in the Glades. Tied up to the concrete pier was
a smaller seaplane.</p>
<p class="pnext">For a moment they rested on their paddles.
Then at a sign from Bill, the other three canoes
made off silently for the yacht.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill pointed his own craft for the amphibian.
He doubted that a harbor watch would be kept
aboard the plane, and in this he found his surmise
correct. Drawing alongside, he made the
canoe fast to an interplane strut, and motioned
to his two companions to climb aboard.</p>
<p class="pnext">While the Seminoles searched the hull, Bill
busied himself with the engine. He removed
two spark plugs, and disconnected the joints in
the pipe line at both the fuel tank and carburetor.
When he had finished the Seminoles
reported that there was no crew aboard.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded his satisfaction and the Indians
followed him back into the canoe. Their next
port of call was the seaplane, moored to the pier,
where the same performance took place. When
this aircraft had also been put out of commission,
they turned their attention to the yacht.</p>
<p class="pnext">As his canoe slid close to the long, black hull
of Martinengo’s palatial craft, Bill dimly discerned
the dark blotches on the waterline below
the overhang of the stern. An instant later, his
canoe nosed in among the Indian dugouts.</p>
<p class="pnext">Not a word was spoken. Except for the lap
of wavelets against the yacht’s hull, and stentorian
snores from somewhere above their heads,
the night was peculiarly silent. From afar
came the dull boom of the surf. Then they
heard the <em class="italics">pop-pop</em> of rifle fire from the interior
of the island, more than a mile away.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill faced about. “If these gunsters show
fight, shoot to kill!” he hissed in a tense whisper.
“But if a man throws down his arms, he is to
be bound and held prisoner. I will have no
murdering of unarmed men. And anyone who
disobeys this order will be shot out of hand by
me. Am I understood?”</p>
<p class="pnext">He was answered by a low chorus of grunts.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then—let’s go!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Leaving but one man to guard the canoes,
the little band swarmed over the low bulwarks
and on to the yacht’s deck. The sailor on watch
was roused from his slumbers to find himself
held fast by painted savages. Before he was
sufficiently awake to shout for help an oily rag
was thrust into his mouth. Then while one
Seminole knotted a scarf about his face to keep
the gag in place, he was trussed up with rope
from the coil on which he had been sleeping.
His bonds were further secured to a ringbolt
in the decking and then he was abandoned.</p>
<p class="pnext">At a word from Bill, four Indians entered the
companionway amidship, while he and the
others hurried on to the forecastle entrance.
He found the door closed, jerked it open and
ran down a steep flight of steps. His hand
groped along the wall in the darkness, there
came the click of a switch and the quarters of
the crew sprang into view. A table ran down
the middle of the long, narrow cabin, and
twelve bunks lined the walls, six on either side.
Eight of these were occupied.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill’s words came sharp as the crack of a
pistol.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hands in the air! Legs overside—and stay
put!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The man in the second bunk on the right
reached stealthily under his pillow, and flashed
an automatic into sight, while Bill’s eyes raked
the other side of the cabin. But before the
sailor could crook his trigger finger, Bill felt
an object whizz past his head from the rear,
and to his astonishment, he saw the man crumple
as though struck by lightning. The dead body
fell to the floor. Imbedded in the middle of
the man’s forehead was a Seminole tomahawk.</p>
<p class="pnext">This summary piece of justice evidently
cowed the other forecastle hands, for they offered
no resistance. They were led on deck and
effectively bound with rope and laid in a row
beside the deck watch.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill did not wholly trust his Seminoles to
keep to the promise he had extracted from them.
In their eyes this night’s work was a vendetta,
war to the death, vengeance to be atoned by
blood alone. They had come here to kill or
be killed. He felt almost certain that they
would murder these prisoners if given the
slightest provocation. Therefore he remained
on deck until the last gunster was laid beside his
fellows, before going below. As it was, he met
the men he had sent down to the cabins as he
entered the companionway.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Anybody down there?” he asked brusquely.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Great Chief, there <em class="italics">were</em> three white men,”
the leader said slowly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where are they?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They were foolish enough to fight, Great
Chief. They have gone to the Happy Hunting
Ground. We have brought their scalps.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill turned away in disgust. Yet there was
nothing he could do. Censure at this stage of
the game would be sure to provoke mutiny.
If he upbraided these savages for acts which
according to their code were acts of justice,
they would probably throw off his leadership
and massacre the remaining prisoners.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yellow Wing!” he beckoned to a subchief.
“You and Long Snake will stay here with these
men. You will be accountable to Chief
Osceola for their safety. The rest of us will
take three of the canoes and go ashore.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill knew that this order did not please the
two Indians, but they made no comment, and
he led his group overside.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the concrete pier he left another Indian
on guard, and then, followed by the remainder
of his band, hastened up the road to the top of
the cliff. Ever since they had heard the report
of the first gun, the firing in the middle of the
island had been practically continuous. Occasionally
it would lessen for a few seconds, to
break out in fresh bursts directly afterward.
Now, as they ran along the road which led down
into the broad valley of the island, the firing
became more intermittent, and at last died away
altogether.</p>
<p class="pnext">They entered the belt of woods and were
traveling along the winding roadway at a trot
when the sound of rifles broke out afresh. This
time, the volleys seemed to come from the
woods ahead. The party stopped and listened.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’re getting nearer,” muttered Bill,
after a moment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“White Man retreating along this road, Red
Man following, Great Chief,” declared an
elderly Seminole at Bill’s side.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How do you know they are White Men,
Straight Arrow?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Those nearest us wear white men’s boots,
Great Chief. No Seminole makes noise like
that when he runs.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill could hear nothing except the firing, but
it never occurred to him to doubt the keen-eared
Indian’s word.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Into the woods!” he commanded. “And
don’t fire until you hear me whistle!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The dark shadows of his savage allies seemed
to melt into the forest. Bill slid behind the
trunk of a palm, from where he had an unobstructed
view of the turn in the road beyond.
He could hear the sound of running footsteps
now. The reports of rifles came nearer and
nearer.</p>
<p class="pnext">Finally a band of fifteen or twenty men appeared
around the bend. In the darkness of
the dense woods it was difficult to distinguish
objects clearly, but Bill saw that four of the men
bore a burden, and as they got well past the
turn in the road, they stopped and lowered it
to the ground. Immediately afterward the
trip hammer detonations of a machine gun
shattered the night.</p>
<p class="pnext">There came a flash and a sharp report from
the woods on the opposite side of the road. The
machine-gunner fell sideways, clutching his
shoulder. Another took the wounded man’s
place. Before Bill could purse his lips to
whistle, first one side of the road, then the other
were raked with a hail of lead.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill could hear the bullets pinging into the
soft palm that sheltered him. He dropped to
the ground and lying flat, opened fire with his
rifle, while the gangsters’ bullets went on singing
above his head. Flashes lit the woods continuously
in every direction now, and the night
was made hideous by the bloodcurdling yells of
the Seminoles.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then another and heavier burst of firing
came from the bend of the road. The machine
gun was suddenly silenced. The few gangsters
that were left turned and fled toward the bay.</p>
<p class="pnext">Out of the woods leapt painted demons,
shouting war cries. The cornered gunmen
wheeled and fought like frenzied rats. No
quarter was asked or given. Presently the
Indians returned to the machine gun.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill stood in the middle of the road, his rifle
at the ready.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The first who touches one of these wounded
gets a bullet from me!” He shouted menacingly at the
Seminoles, who, he knew were bent
on taking their trophy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And I’m with you on that, Bill!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Osceola ran up, accompanied by his band of
painted henchmen, and immediately reeled off
a series of fiercely shouted gutterals in Seminole.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That will hold them for a while,” he added
in English to Bill. “There’ll be no scalping if
I can stop it.—Sam! Where’s that nigger?”
he raised his voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here I is, Marse Osceola. Here I is, suh.
’Fore de Lord, I ain’t scalped a prizner!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, shut up, and pass over that electric
torch you’ve been carrying for me. I want to
get an idea of the damage done here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yas, suh, boss! Here it am, suh.” Sam
was still stuttering as he handed Osceola the
flashlight. “Truly, I ain’t done no scalpin’
tonight, Marse——”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Keep still—or I’ll scalp you!” The chief
switched on the light. “Well, if you caught
the lads afloat,” he said to Bill, “this is the last
of the gang ashore.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean they’re all wiped out?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, hardly. Some are, of course, a good
number, too. But the live ones are under lock
and key in the jail.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But Osceola—did you find Dad?” Bill’s
voice was trembling with eagerness.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sorry, old man—he’s not on the island.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What! Don’t tell me he’s dead?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, no. Nothing like that. I captured
the barracks boss, who seems to be a pretty
sound egg. He says that Martinengo left for
the workings in Big Cypress—it seems he is a
trained pilot. He took your own plane, and
forced your father to go with him.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xviiibig-cypress-again">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id19">CHAPTER XVIII—BIG CYPRESS AGAIN</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Three o’clock on the afternoon of the next
day found the two young men standing on the
concrete pier, watching the narrow entrance to
the bay. Beside them stood the old negro, Sam,
an incongruous figure in his war paint, and
armed to the teeth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here they come!” cried Bill, as two wicked-looking
destroyers, belching smoke from their
squat funnels, glided into the harbor. “The
old U. S. Navy is pretty prompt, once it gets
started, eh? That isn’t bad time at all from
Key West!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Lucky we were able to reach them by phone.
That second ship is letting go her anchor. The
one in the lead seems to be making for this
pier.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I told them there was plenty of water,”
said Bill, and they waited where they were until
the destroyer laid alongside and made fast.
A young man whose smart white uniform bore
the black and gold shoulder stripes of a
lieutenant-commander ran lightly across the
gangway. He was followed by a chief petty
officer and a file of men carrying rifles. Bill
and Osceola stepped forward to meet them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who’s in command here?” inquired the
officer.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am, sir.” Bill stood stiffly at attention.
He did not salute. It is not Naval etiquette to
do so unless one is in uniform, wearing one’s cap.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mr. Bolton, I take it,” smiled the officer.
“My name is Bellinger. If it’s okay with you,
Mr. Bolton, I’ll take over now?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Please do.” They shook hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill then introduced Osceola and gave Commander
Bellinger a brief report of his experiences
during the past ten days.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’ve buried the dead gunsters,” he ended,
“and the live ones are safely housed in their
own jail.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My word!” exclaimed the Commander.
“You chaps have certainly put in an interesting
summer vacation—if not a very pleasant one!
You’ve seen more scrapping in a few days than
I have since the Armistice!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The Seminoles were a bit difficult to control,
sir,” Bill went on rather hesitantly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Commander Bellinger nodded. “I’ll bet
they were. Probably scalped a few of the gunmen,
eh? Well, what I don’t know won’t go
into my report. The fortunes of war, you know.
But I want you to understand now, Bolton, that
the report won’t do <em class="italics">you</em> any harm with the
Superintendent of the Naval Academy—quite
the reverse, in fact. Both you and Chief
Osceola have done well—very well indeed.
And,” he added, “I think we’d better look over
this gangster outfit. You’ll want to start your
hop soon, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill nodded as they walked toward the hill.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have orders to meet a squadron of seaplanes
from Pensacola Air Station at four
o’clock in Whitewater Bay, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How long will it take you to fly over there?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Something under an hour, sir. With your
permission I’d like the small Loening moored
out yonder, and take Chief Osceola with me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s okay with me, Bolton. But we’ll
have to get going with this inspection. Before
you leave I’ll give you the admiral’s orders, and
another envelope which you will turn over to
Commander Thomson when you meet the seaplane
squadron.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Bill, and the three
breasted the winding road up the cliff.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p class="pfirst">Bill pushed forward the stick, at the same
time he cut his gun and the Loening amphibian
he was piloting shot downward. Far below,
the island-studded waters of Whitewater Bay
sparkled in the summer sunlight. Lying on
its quiet bosom like great waterbugs with wings
spread were the five seaplanes of the Navy
Squadron moored in simple V-formation. Even
at that distance, Bill could make out the difference
in design of the flying boats.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Three Boeing PB-1’s,” he announced into
the mouthpiece of his headphone. “The other
two are PN-10’s.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll take your word for it,” answered
Osceola. “It’s all Greek to me. But how can
you tell them apart at this distance?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Easily enough—knowing their construction.
The PB boats have a tandem engine
mounting, for one thing. Can’t talk now—this
has got to be a good landing. We’ve a bunch of
experts watching us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He brought his stick slowly backward, bringing
up the nose to level. Then he applied right
aileron and simultaneously increased right
rudder considerably. When the desired bank
was reached, he checked the wing with the
ailerons and at the same time eased the pressure
on the rudder.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the plane swung round so that it
headed directly into the wind, Bill applied left
aileron and left rudder. With wings level once
more, he neutralized the ailerons and applied a
normal amount of right rudder to steady her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Once more he nosed over, and this time the
Loening sped downward on a straight path into
the wind, at an angle of 45 degrees. At a point
equidistant from the two rear seaplanes of the
moored squadron, Bill leveled off. A moment
later, with hardly a splash his plane caressed the
water and glided forward under its own momentum
until it came to rest directly aft of the
squadron’s leading seaplane.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill loosened the chinstrap of his helmet, as
a figure in a monkeysuit walked out on the lower
wing section of the big PB boat, and waved.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That you, Bolton?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good afternoon, Commander. I’ve got the
admiral’s orders aboard.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good enough,” returned Commander
Thomson. “Nose that Loening over here and
let me have them. That was a smart landing
you made just now. You’re a credit to your
old instructor!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Aye, aye, sir,” replied Bill, with a wink at
Osceola, and did as he was bid.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And I notice you haven’t lost your nerve,
either,” smiled the Commander as he took the
long blue envelope that Bill handed him.
“Cheek is a better word, perhaps.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I never try to correct my superior officer,”
laughed Bill, and they shook hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Commander Thomson slit the envelope and
read the message.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The Old Man says you are to lead us over,”
he announced. “And I take it you know what to
do when we get there.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, sir. Received instructions from Commander
Bellinger. I’ve got the letter in my
pocket. He sent his best regards to you, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good old Pat. I bet he’d give half a stripe
to be with us. We’ll shove off directly. Run
your boat up to thirty-five hundred and retain
that altitude until you zoom the stockade. Then
climb until you are above us and don’t land until
you see me on the water. Got that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let’s go, then. Good luck!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Same to you, Commander.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill returned to the cockpit of his plane and
presently the Loening was taxiing ahead,
preparatory to her take-off.</p>
<p class="pnext">Once in the air, he climbed to the prescribed
thirty-five hundred feet. A sharp flipper turn
brought the little amphibian on a compass course
slightly west of north. Directly on his tail came
Commander Thomson’s PB-1, with the other
four planes of the squadron bringing up the
rear in V-formation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill, of course, did not know the exact location
in Big Cypress of Martinengo’s gold diggings,
but here Osceola’s uncanny bump of
direction came into play once more. Not ever
did the young Seminole appear at a loss. On
they sped, straight as an arrow shot from a bow.</p>
<p class="pnext">The sun was three-quarters down the horizon
when they caught sight of the lagoon in the
cypress swamp, with the stockade close beside
it. They had timed their arrival to a nicety.
The prisoners had just been locked up for the
night and their guards were going to supper.</p>
<p class="pnext">Forward went Bill’s stick and he dived for
the buildings with a wide open throttle. He
caught a fleeting glimpse of figures running on
the open quadrangle that seemed rushing up to
meet him. Then back came his stick again.
The Loening bucked like a frightened bronco
and zoomed upward a bare fifty feet above
Mother Earth. As she rose, a weighted letter
was dropped overboard.</p>
<p class="pnext">Again Bill climbed, until his plane reached
an altitude of possibly a hundred feet above the
squadron, which had changed its formation and
was now flying in a continuous circle, high above
the stockade. Bill leveled off and sent his plane
into a series of reverse control turns known as
figure eights.</p>
<p class="pnext">Less than five minutes later, the two in the
Loening saw a procession of men form in front
of the bosses’ headquarters. From there they
marched two by two out of the stockade and
down the corduroy to the dock. One of the
leaders carried a white flag.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill reached for a pair of fieldglasses and
clapped them to his eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Martinengo’s in front, with the flag!” he
cried into the mouthpiece of his phone, nearly
deafening Osceola in his excitement. “And
yes—that’s Dad—beside him! Gee whiz! If
I was a Frenchman, I could kiss the old Admiral!
His letter did the trick, Osceola. That
old boy is some humdinger!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Wonder what he said in it. It certainly
brought them out in a hurry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Bill laughed. “Bellinger let me read it.
Short and to the point—that’s the Navy. It
read: ‘You are through, Martinengo. Walk
down to the dock with your men—unarmed.
Bring Mr. Bolton with you. My planes are
bombers. Charles S. Black, Rear Admiral,
U. S. N.’”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Short and sweet, and very <em class="italics">much</em> to the
point!” laughed Osceola. Two seaplanes
glided down out of the circular formation below
them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There goes the skipper,” exclaimed Bill.
“It’s about time we went down and you were
introduced to Dad.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Okay, boy, but watch your step. We don’t
want to crack up now when everything’s turned
out so beautifully.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Unh-unh—Not me!” grinned Bill, and
nosed her over.</p>
